# CLP-1 LaTeX source files
* The text and problem sets were originally written in latex as separate books.
* These are given in the textbook and problembook subdirectores.
* The source files should be compiled with pdflatex.

## Figure files
* The figures were drawn using one of
    * inkscape,
    * tikz, and
    * [figPac](http://www.math.ubc.ca/~feldman/figPacDoc/figPacIntro.html) a java library written by one of the authors.
* We have tried to give the figure source files where practical.
