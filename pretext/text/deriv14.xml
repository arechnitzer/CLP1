<title>Higher Order Derivatives</title>
<subsection><title>Higher Order Derivatives</title>
<p>The operation of differentiation takes as input one function,
<m>f(x)</m>, and produces as output another function, <m>f'(x)</m>. Now <m>f'(x)</m> is
once again a function. So we can differentiate it again, assuming that
it is differentiable, to create a third function, called the second
derivative of <m>f</m>. And we can differentiate the second derivative again
to create a fourth function, called the third derivative of <m>f</m>.
And so on.</p>

<definition xml:id="not_higherOrdDeriv">
<statement><p>
<ul>
<li> <m>f''(x)</m> and <m>f^{(2)}(x)</m>  and <m>\ddiff{2}{f}{x}(x)</m> all mean
<m>\diff{}{x}\big(\diff{}{x}f(x)\big)</m>
</li>
<li> <m>f'''(x)</m> and <m>f^{(3)}(x)</m>  and <m>\ddiff{3}{f}{x}(x)</m> all mean

</li>
<li> <m>f^{(4)}(x)</m>  and <m>\ddiff{4}{f}{x}(x)</m> both mean
<m>\diff{}{x}\big(\diff{}{x}\big(\diff{}{x}\big(\diff{}{x}f(x)\big)\big)\big)</m>
</li>
<li> and so on.

<p>Here is a simple example. Then we'll think a little about the significance
of second order derivatives. Then we'll do a more a computationally complex
example.
</p>

<example xml:id="eg_higherOrdDerivA"><title>Derivatives of <m>x^n</m></title>
<p>
Let <m>n</m> be a natural number and let <m>f(x)= x^n</m>. Then
<md>
<mrow>
\diff{}{x}x^n&amp;=nx^{n-1}
</mrow><mrow>
\ddiff{2}{}{x}x^n&amp;=\diff{}{x}\big(nx^{n-1}\big)=n(n-1)x^{n-2}
</mrow><mrow>
\ddiff{3}{}{x}x^n&amp;=\diff{}{x}\big(n(n-1)x^{n-2}\big)=n(n-1)(n-2)x^{n-3}
</mrow>
</md>
Each time we differentiate, we bring down the exponent, which is exactly
one smaller than the previous exponent brought down, and we reduce the
exponent by one. By the time we have differentiated <m>n-1</m> times,
the exponent has decreased to <m>n-(n-1)=1</m> and we have brought down the
factors <m>n(n-1)(n-2)\cdots 2</m>. So
<md>
<mrow>
\ddiff{{n-1}}{}{x}x^n&amp;=n(n-1)(n-2)\cdots 2x
</mrow>
</md>
and
<md>
<mrow>
\ddiff{n}{}{x}x^n&amp;=n(n-1)(n-2)\cdots 1
</mrow>
</md>
The product of the first <m>n</m> natural numbers, <m>1\cdot 2\cdot 3\cdot \cdots
\cdot n,</m> is called <q><m>n</m> factorial</q> and is denoted <m>n!</m>. So we can also
write
<md>
<mrow>
\ddiff{n}{}{x}x^n&amp;=n!
</mrow>
</md>
If <m>m \gt n</m>, then
<md>
<mrow>
\ddiff{m}{}{x}x^n&amp;=0
</mrow>
</md>
</p></example>

<example xml:id="eg_2_14_1"><title>Position, velocity and acceleration</title>
<p>
Recall that the derivative <m>v'(a)</m> is the (instantaneous) rate of
change of the function <m>v(t)</m> at <m>t=a</m>. Suppose that you are walking on
the <m>x</m><ndash/>axis and that <m>x(t)</m> is your <m>x</m><ndash/>coordinate at time <m>t</m>.
Also suppose, for simplicity, that you are moving from left to right.
Then <m>v(t)=x'(t)</m> is your velocity at time <m>t</m> and <m>v'(a)=x''(a)</m> is the
rate at which your velocity is changing at time <m>t=a</m>. It is called your
acceleration. In particular, if <m>x''(a) \gt 0</m>, then your velocity is increasing,
i.e. you are speeding up, at time <m>a</m>. If <m>x''(a) \lt 0</m>, then your velocity
is decreasing, i.e. you are slowing down, at time <m>a</m>. That's one
interpretation of the second derivative.

<example xml:id="eg_higherOrdDerivC"><title><xref ref="eg_DIFFimpldiffD"/> continued</title>
<p>
Find <m>y''</m> if <m>y=y^3+xy+x^3</m>.
</p>

<p><alert>Solution</alert> This problem concerns some function <m>y(x)</m> that is not
given to us explicitly. All that we are told is that <m>y(x)</m> satisfies
<me>
y(x)=y(x)^3+xy(x)+x^3
\tag{E1}
</me>
for all <m>x</m>. We are asked to find <m>y''(x)</m>. We cannot solve this
equation to get an explicit formula for <m>y(x)</m>.  So we use implicit
differentiation, as we did in Example <xref ref="eg_DIFFimpldiffD"/>. That is, we apply
<m>\diff{}{x}</m> to both sides of (E1). This gives
<me>
y'(x)=3y(x)^2\,y'(x)+y(x)+x\,y'(x)+3x^2
\tag{E2}
</me>
which we can solve for <m>y'(x)</m>, by moving all <m>y'(x)</m>'s to the left hand
side, giving
<me>
 \big[1-x-3y(x)^2\big]y'(x) = y(x)+3x^2
</me>
and then dividing across.
<me>
y'(x) = \frac{y(x)+3x^2}{1-x-3y(x)^2}
\tag{E3}
</me>
To get <m>y''(x)</m>, we have two options.
</p>

<p><em>Method 1.</em>  Apply <m>\diff{}{x}</m> to both sides of (E2).
This gives
<me>
y''(x)=3y(x)^2\,y''(x)+6y(x)\,y'(x)^2+2y'(x)+x\,y''(x)+6x
</me>
We can now solve for <m>y''(x)</m>, giving
<me>
y''(x) = \frac{6x+2y'(x)+6y(x)y'(x)^2}{1-x-3y(x)^2}
\tag{E4}
</me>
Then we can substitute in (E3), giving
<md>
<mrow>
\amp y''(x) = 2\frac{3x+ \frac{y(x)+3x^2}{1-x-3y(x)^2}
              +3y(x) \big(\frac{y(x)+3x^2}{1-x-3y(x)^2}\big)^2}
         {1-x-3y(x)^2}
</mrow><mrow>
&amp;= 2\frac{3x{[1\!-\!x\!-\!3y(x)^2]}^2+ [y(x)\!+\!3x^2][1\!-\!x\!-\!3y(x)^2]

</mrow>
</md>
</p>

<p><em>Method 2.</em>  Alternatively, we can also differentiate (E3).
<md>
<mrow>
\amp y''(x) = \frac{[y'(x)+6x][1\!-\!x\!-\!3y(x)^2]-
           [y(x)+3x^2][-1-6y(x)y'(x)]}{{[1-x-3y(x)^2]}^2}

                                       {{[1-x-3y(x)^2]}^2}
</mrow><mrow>
&amp;= \frac{2[y(x)+3x^2][1\!-\!x\!-\!3y(x)^2]+6x{[1\!-\!x\!-\!3y(x)^2]}^2

                                       {{[1-x-3y(x)^2]}^3}
</mrow>
</md>
</p>

<p><em>Remark 1.</em> We have now computed <m>y''(x)</m> <mdash/> sort of.
The answer is in terms of <m>y(x)</m>, which we don't know. Since we cannot
get an explicit formula for <m>y(x)</m>, there's not a great deal that we can do,
in general.
</p>

<p><em>Remark 2.</em> Even though we cannot solve
<m>y=y^3+xy+x^3</m> explicitly for <m>y(x)</m>, for general <m>x</m>, it is sometimes
possible to solve equations like this for some special values of <m>x</m>.
In fact, we saw in Example <xref ref="eg_DIFFimpldiffD"/> that when <m>x=1</m>,
the given equation reduces to <m>y(1)=y(1)^3+1\cdot y(1)+1^3</m>, or <m>y(1)^3=-1</m>,
which we can solve to get <m>y(1)=-1</m>. Substituting into (E2),
as we did in  Example <xref ref="eg_DIFFimpldiffD"/> gives
<me>
y'(1) = \frac{-1+3}{1-1-3(-1)^2} = -\frac{2}{3}
</me>
and substituting into (E4) gives
<me>
y''(1) = \frac{6+2\big(-\frac{2}{3}\big)+6(-1)\big(-\frac{2}{3}\big)^2}
                             {1-1-3(-1)^2}
   =\frac{6-\frac{4}{3}-\frac{8}{3}}{-3}
   = -\frac{2}{3}
</me>
(It's a fluke that, in this example, <m>y'(1)</m> and <m>y''(1)</m> happen to be equal.)
So we now know that, even though we can't solve <m>y=y^3+xy+x^3</m> explicitly for
<m>y(x)</m>, the graph of the solution passes through <m>(1,-1)</m> and has slope
<m>-\frac{2}{3}</m> (i.e. is sloping downwards by between <m>30^\circ</m> and <m>45^\circ</m>)
there and, furthermore, the slope of the graph decreases as <m>x</m>
increases through <m>x=1</m>.
</p>

<sidebyside width="33%">
 <image source="text/figs/concaveDown"/>
 </sidebyside>

<p>Here is a sketch of the part of the graph very near <m>(1, -1)</m>. The tangent line to the
graph at <m>(1, -1)</m> is also shown. Note that the tangent line is sloping down to the right,
as we expect, and that the graph lies below the tangent line near <m>(1,-1)</m>. That's because
the slope <m>f'(x)</m> is decreasing (becoming more negative) as <m>x</m> passes through <m>1</m>.
</p>
</example>


<warning xml:id="warning_dropx">
<p>
Many people will suppress the <m>(x)</m> in <m>y(x)</m> when doing
computations like those in Example <xref ref="eg_higherOrdDerivC"/>.
This gives shorter, easier to read formulae, like
<m>y'=\frac{y+3x^2}{1-x-3y^2}</m>. If you do this, you must never forget
that <m>y</m> is a function of <m>x</m> and is <em>not</em> a constant. If you do forget,
you'll make the very serious error of saying that <m>\diff{y}{x}=0</m>,
which is false.
