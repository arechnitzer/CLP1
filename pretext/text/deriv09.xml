<title>One More Tool  <ndash/> the Chain Rule</title>
<introduction>

<p>We have built up most of the tools that we need to express derivatives of
complicated functions in terms of derivatives of simpler known functions.
We started by learning how to evaluate
<ul>
<li> derivatives of sums, products and quotients
</li>
<li> derivatives of constants and monomials
</li>
</ul>
These tools allow us to compute derivatives of polynomials and
rational functions. In the previous sections, we added exponential and trigonometric
functions to our list. The final tool we add is called the chain rule.
It tells us how to take the derivative of a composition of two functions.
That is if we know <m>f(x)</m> and <m>g(x)</m> and their derivatives, then the chain
rule tells us the derivative of <m>f\big(g(x)\big)</m>.
</p>

<p>Before we get to the statement of the rule, let us look at an
example showing how such a composition might arise (in the  <q>real-world</q>).
</p>

<example xml:id="eg_DIFFcampfire"><title>Walking towards a campfire</title>
<p>
You are out in the woods after a long day of mathematics and are
walking towards your camp fire on a beautiful still night. The heat
from the fire means that the air temperature depends on your position.
Let your position at time <m>t</m> be <m>x(t)</m>. The temperature of the air
at position <m>x</m> is <m>f(x)</m>. What instantaneous rate of change of
temperature do you feel at time<nbsp/><m>t</m>?</p>

<sidebyside width="50%">
<image source="text/figs/campfire2"/>
</sidebyside>

<p>
<ul>
<li> Because your position at time <m>t</m> is <m>x=x(t)</m>, the temperature you feel
at time <m>t</m> is <m>F(t)=f\big(x(t)\big)</m>.
</li>
<li> The instantaneous rate of change of temperature that you feel is <m>F'(t)</m>. We have a
complicated function, <m>F(t)</m>, constructed by composing two simpler functions, <m>x(t)</m> and
<m>f(x)</m>.
</li>
<li> We wish to compute the derivative, <m>F'(t) = \diff{}{t} f( x(t) )</m>,
of the complicated function <m>F(t)</m> in terms of the derivatives,  <m>x'(t)</m>
and <m>f'(x)</m>, of the two simple functions. This is exactly what the
chain rule does.
</li>
</ul>

<title>Statement of the Chain Rule</title>

<theorem xml:id="thm_DIFFchainRuleV1"><title>The chain rule  <mdash/> version 1</title>
<statement><p>
  Let <m>a \in \mathbb{R}</m> and let <m>g(x)</m> be a function that is differentiable at
<m>x=a</m>. Now let <m>f(u)</m> be a function that is differentiable at
<m>u=g(a)</m>. Then the function <m>F(x) = f(g(x))</m> is differentiable at <m>x=a</m> and
<md>
<mrow>
  F'(a) &amp;=f'\big(g(a)\big)\,g'(a)
</mrow>
</md>
</p></statement>
</theorem>

<p>
Here, as was the case earlier in this chapter,  we have been very
careful to give the point at which the derivative is evaluated a special
name (i.e. <m>a</m>). But of course this evaluation point can really be
any point (where the derivative is defined).
So it is very common to just call the evaluation point <q><m>x</m></q> rather
than give it a special name like <q><m>a</m></q>, like this:
</p>

<theorem xml:id="thm_DIFFchainRuleV2"><title>The chain rule <mdash/> version 2</title>
<statement><p>
 Let <m>f</m> and <m>g</m> be differentiable functions then
  <md>
<mrow>
  \diff{}{x} f\big( g( x) \big) &amp;= f'\big(g(x)\big) \cdot g'(x)
</mrow>
</md>
</p></statement>
</theorem>

<p>
Notice that when we form the composition <m>f\big(g(x)\big)</m> there
is an <q>outside</q> function (namely <m>f(x)</m>) and an <q>inside</q> function
(namely <m>g(x)</m>). The chain rule tells us that when we differentiate
a composition that we have to differentiate the outside and then
multiply by the derivative of the inside.
<md>
<mrow>
  \diff{}{x} f\big( g( x) \big)
   &amp;= \underbrace{f'\big(g(x)\big)}_\text{diff outside} \cdot
                          \underbrace{g'(x)}_\text{diff inside}
</mrow>
</md>
Here is another statement of the chain rule which makes this idea more
explicit.
</p>

<theorem xml:id="thm_DIFFchainRuleV3"><title>The chain rule <mdash/> version 3</title>
<statement><p>
  Let <m>y = f(u)</m> and <m>u = g(x)</m> be differentiable functions, then
  <md>
<mrow>
  \diff{y}{x} &amp;= \diff{y}{u} \cdot \diff{u}{x}
</mrow>
</md>
</p></statement>
</theorem>

<p> This particular form is easy to remember because it looks like we can just
<q>cancel</q> the <m>\mathrm{d}u</m> between the two terms.
  <md>
<mrow>
  \diff{y}{x} &amp;= \frac{\mathrm{d}{y}}{\cancel{\mathrm{d}u}} \cdot
\frac{\cancel{\mathrm{d}{u}}}{\mathrm{d}x}
</mrow>
</md>
</p>

<p>Of course,  <m>\mathrm{d}u</m> is not, by itself, a number or variable
<fn>In this context <m>\mathrm{d}u</m> is called a differential. There are ways to
understand and manipulate these in calculus but they are beyond the scope of
this course.</fn>
that can be cancelled. But this is still a good memory aid.
</p>

<p>The hardest part about applying the chain rule is recognising
when the function you are trying to differentiate is really
the composition of two simpler functions. This takes a little practice.
We can warm up with a couple of simple examples.
</p>

<example xml:id="eg_DIFFchainruleA"><title>Derivative of a power of <m>\sin x</m></title>
<p>
 Let <m>f(u) = u^5</m> and <m>g(x) = \sin(x)</m>. Then set
<m>F(x) = f\big(g(x)\big) = \big(\sin(x)\big)^5</m>. To find the
derivative of <m>F(x)</m> we can simply apply the chain rule  <mdash/>
the pieces of the composition have been laid out for us. Here
they are.
<md>
<mrow>
  f(u) &amp;= u^5 &amp; f'(u) &amp;= 5u^4
</mrow><mrow>
  g(x) &amp;= \sin(x) &amp; g'(x) &amp;= \cos x
</mrow>
</md>
We now just put them together as the chain rule tells us
<md>
<mrow>
  \diff{F}{x} &amp;= f'\big(g(x)\big) \cdot g'(x)
</mrow><mrow>
  &amp;= 5\big(g(x)\big)^4 \cdot \cos(x) &amp; \text{since } f'(u) = 5u^4
</mrow><mrow>
  &amp;= 5 \big(\sin(x)\big)^4 \cdot \cos(x)
</mrow>
</md>
</p>

<p>Notice that it is quite easy to extend this to any power.
Set <m>f(u) = u^n</m>. Then follow the same steps and we arrive at
<md>
<mrow>
  F(x) &amp;= (\sin(x))^n &amp; F'(x) &amp;= n \big(\sin(x) \big)^{n-1} \cos(x)
</mrow>
</md>
</p></example>


<p>This example shows one of the ways that the chain rule appears
very frequently <mdash/> when we need to differentiate the power of
some simpler function. More generally we have the following.</p>

<example xml:id="eg_2_9_1"><title>Derivative of a power of a function</title>
<p>
 Let <m>f(u) = u^n</m> and let <m>g(x)</m> be any differentiable function.
Set <m>F(x) = f\big(g(x)\big) = g(x)^n</m>. Then
<md>
<mrow>
  \diff{F}{x} = \diff{}{x} \big( g(x)^n \big) &amp;= n g(x)^{n-1} \cdot g'(x)
</mrow>
</md>
This is precisely the result in Example<nbsp/><xref ref="eg_DIFFsimpleToolsA"/>  and
Lemma<nbsp/><xref ref="lem_diff_ftothen"/>.
</p></example>


<example xml:id="eg_2_9_2"><title>Derivative of <m>\cos(3x-2)</m></title>
<p>
  Let <m>f(u) = \cos(u)</m> and <m>g(x) = 3x-2</m>. Find the derivative of
<md>
<mrow>
  F(x) &amp;= f\big(g(x)\big) = \cos(3x-2).
</mrow>
</md>
</p>

<p>Again we should approach this by first writing down <m>f</m> and <m>g</m> and their
derivatives and then putting everything together as the chain rule tells us.
<md>
<mrow>
  f(u) &amp;= \cos(u) &amp; f'(u) &amp;= -\sin(u)
</mrow><mrow>
  g(x) &amp;= 3x-2 &amp; g'(x) &amp;= 3
</mrow>
</md>
So the chain rule says
<md>
<mrow>
  F'(x) &amp;= f'\big(g(x)\big) \cdot g'(x)
</mrow><mrow>
  &amp;= -\sin\big( g(x) \big) \cdot 3
</mrow><mrow>
  &amp;= -3 \sin(3x-2)
</mrow>
</md>
</p></example>


<p>This example shows a second way that the chain rule appears
very frequently <mdash/> when we need to differentiate some function
of <m>ax+b</m>. More generally we have the following.</p>

<example xml:id="eg_DIFFchainaxb"><title>Derivative of <m>f(ax+b)</m></title>
<p>
  Let <m>a,b \in \mathbb{R}</m> and let <m>f(x)</m> be a differentiable function.
Set  <m>g(x) = ax+b</m>. Then
  <md>
<mrow>
  \diff{}{x} f(ax+b) &amp;= \diff{}{x} f\big(g(x)\big)
</mrow><mrow>
  &amp;= f'\big(g(x)\big) \cdot g'(x)
</mrow><mrow>
  &amp;= f'(ax+b) \cdot a
</mrow>
</md>
So the derivative of <m>f(ax+b)</m> with respect to <m>x</m> is just <m>a f'(ax+b)</m>.
</p></example>

<p>The above is a very useful result that follows from the chain rule, so lets make it a
corollary to highlight it.</p>

<corollary xml:id="cor_f_of_axb">
<statement><p>
  Let <m>a,b \in \mathbb{R}</m> and let <m>f(x)</m> be a differentiable function, then
<md>
<mrow>
  \diff{}{x} f(ax+b) &amp;= af'(ax+b).
</mrow>
</md>
</p></statement>
</corollary>

<example xml:id="eg_DIFFcampfireB"><title><xref ref="eg_DIFFcampfire"/> continued</title>
<p>
Let us now go back to our motivating campfire example. There we had
<md>
<mrow>
  f(x) &amp;= \text{ temperature at position $x$}
</mrow><mrow>
  x(t) &amp;= \text{ position at time $t$}
</mrow><mrow>
  F(t) &amp;= f(x(t)) = \text{ temperature at time $t$}
</mrow>
</md>
The chain rule gave
<md>
<mrow>
  F'(t) &amp;= f'\big(x(t)\big) \cdot x'(t)
</mrow>
</md>
Notice that the units of measurement on both sides of the equation agree
<mdash/> as indeed they must. To see this, let us assume that <m>t</m> is measured
in seconds, that <m>x(t)</m> is measured in metres and that <m>f(x)</m> is measured in
degrees. Because of this <m>F(x(t))</m> must also be measured in degrees (since it is
a temperature).
</p>

<p>What about the derivatives? These are rates of change. So
<ul>
<li> <m>F'(t)</m> has units <m>\frac{\rm degrees}{\rm second}</m>,
</li>
<li> <m>f'(x)</m> has units <m>\frac{\rm degrees}{\rm metre}</m>, and
</li>
<li> <m>x'(t)</m> has units <m>\frac{\rm metre}{\rm second}</m>.
</li>
</ul>
Hence the product
<md>
<mrow>
  f'\big(x(t)\big) \cdot x'(t) &amp;
   \text{ has units } = \frac{\rm degrees}{\rm metre} \cdot
                              \frac{\rm metre}{\rm second}
   = \frac{\rm degrees}{\rm second}.
</mrow>
</md>
has the same units as <m>F'(t)</m>.
So the units on both sides of the equation agree. Checking
that the units on both sides of an equation agree is a good
check of consistency, but of course it does not prove that both sides
are in fact the same.
</p></example>

<subsection>
<title>(Optional) <mdash/> Derivation of the Chain Rule</title>

<p>First, let's review what our goal is. We have been given a function
<m>g(x)</m>, that is differentiable at some point <m>x=a</m>, and another function
<m>f(u)</m>, that is differentiable at the point <m>u=b = g(a)</m>. We have defined
the composite function <m>F(x) = f\big(g(x)\big)</m> and we wish to show that
<md>
<mrow>
  F'(a) &amp;= f'\big(g(a)\big) \cdot g'(a)
</mrow>
</md>
</p>

<p>Before we can compute <m>F'(a)</m>, we need to set up some
ground work, and in particular the definitions of our given derivatives:
<md>
<mrow>
  f'(b) &amp;= \lim_{H \to 0} \frac{f(b+H)-f(b)}{H} &amp; \text{and }&amp;&amp;
  g'(a) &amp;= \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{g(a+h)-g(a)}{h}.
</mrow>
</md>
We are going to use similar manipulation tricks as we did back in the proofs of the
arithmetic of derivatives in Section<nbsp/><xref ref="sec_proof_arith_deriv"/>. Unfortunately, we have
already used up the symbols <q><m>F</m></q> and <q><m>H</m></q>, so we are going to make use the Greek
letters <m>\gamma, \varphi</m>.
</p>

<p>As was the case in our derivation of the product rule it is convenient to
introduce a couple of new functions. Set
<md>
<mrow>
  \varphi(H) &amp;= \frac{f(b+H)-f(b)}{H}
</mrow>
</md>
Then we have
<md>
<mrow>
  \lim_{H \to 0} \varphi(H) &amp;= f'(b) = f'\big(g(a)\big) &amp; \text{since } b=g(a),
</mrow>
</md>
and we can also write (with a little juggling)
<md>
<mrow>
  f(b+H) &amp;= f(b) + H \varphi(H)
</mrow>
</md>
Similarly set
<md>
<mrow>
  \gamma(h) &amp;= \frac{g(a+h)-g(a)}{h}
</mrow>
</md>
which gives us
<md>
<mrow>
  \lim_{h \to 0} \gamma(h) &amp;= g'(a)
  &amp; \text{ and } &amp;&amp;
  g(a+h) &amp;= g(a) + h \gamma(h).
</mrow>
</md>
</p>

<p>Now we can start computing
<md>
<mrow>
  F'(a) &amp;= \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{F(a+h)-F(a)}{h}
</mrow><mrow>
  &amp;= \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{f\big(g(a+h)\big)-f\big(g(a)\big)}{h}
</mrow>
</md>
We know that <m>g(a) = b</m> and <m>g(a+h) = g(a) + h \gamma(h))</m>, so
<md>
<mrow>
  F'(a)
  &amp;= \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{f\big(g(a) + h\gamma(h) \big)-f\big(g(a)\big)}{h}
</mrow><mrow>
  &amp;= \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{f(b + h\gamma(h) )-f(b)}{h}
</mrow>
</md>
Now for the sneaky bit. We can turn <m>f(b + h\gamma(h) )</m>
into <m>f(b+H)</m> by setting
<md>
<mrow>
H = h\gamma(h)
</mrow>
</md>
Now notice that as <m>h \to 0</m> we have
<md>
<mrow>
  \lim_{h \to 0} H &amp;= \lim_{h \to 0} h \cdot \gamma(h)
</mrow><mrow>
  &amp;= \lim_{h \to 0} h \cdot \lim_{h \to 0} \gamma(h)
</mrow><mrow>
  &amp;= 0 \cdot g'(a) = 0
</mrow>
</md>
So as <m>h\to 0</m> we also have <m>H \to 0</m>.
</p>

<p>We now have
<md>
<mrow>
  F'(a)
  &amp;= \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{f\big(b + H\big)-f(b)}{h}
</mrow><mrow>
  &amp;= \lim_{h \to 0}
    \underbrace{\frac{f\big(b + H\big)-f(b)}{H}}_{= \varphi(H) } \cdot
    \underbrace{\frac{H}{h}}_{ = \gamma(h)}
&amp; \text{if } H= h \gamma(h) \ne 0
</mrow><mrow>
  &amp;= \lim_{h \to 0}\big( \varphi(H) \cdot \gamma(h) \big)
</mrow><mrow>
  &amp;= \lim_{h \to 0} \varphi(H) \cdot \lim_{h \to 0} \gamma(h)  &amp; \text{since $H\to0$ as $h\to 0$}
</mrow><mrow>
  &amp;= \lim_{H \to 0} \varphi(H) \cdot \lim_{h \to 0} \gamma(h)
  &amp;= f'(b) \cdot g'(a)
</mrow>
</md>
This is exactly the RHS of the chain rule. It is possible to have <m>H=0</m> 
in the second line above. But that possibility is easy to deal with:
<ul>
<li>
If <m>g'(a)\ne 0</m>, then, since <m>\lim_{h \to 0} \gamma(h) = g'(a)</m>, 
<m>H= h \gamma(h)</m> cannot be <m>0</m> for small nonzero <m>h</m>. 
Technically, there is an <m>h_0\gt 0</m> such that <m>H= h \gamma(h)\ne 0</m> for all <m>0 \lt |h| \lt h_0</m>. In taking the limit <m>h\to 0</m>, above, we 
need only consider <m>0 \lt |h| \lt h_0</m> and so, in this case, 
the above computation is completely correct. 
</li><li>
If <m>g'(a)=0</m>, the above computation is still fine provided we exclude all 
<m>h</m>'s for which <m>H= h \gamma(h)\ne 0</m>. When <m>g'(a)=0</m>, the right hand side, <m>f'\big(g(a)\big) \cdot g'(a)</m>, of the chain rule is <m>0</m>. 
So the above computation gives  
<me>
\lim_{\genfrac{}{}{0pt}{}{h \to 0}{\gamma(h)\ne 0}} \frac{f\big(b + H\big)-f(b)}{h}
=f'\big(g(a)\big) \cdot g'(a) = 0
</me>
On the other hand, when <m>H=0</m>, we have <m>f\big(b + H\big)-f(b)=0</m>. So
<me>
\lim_{\genfrac{}{}{0pt}{}{h \to 0}{\gamma(h) = 0}} \frac{f\big(b + H\big)-f(b)}{h}
=0
</me>
too. That's all we need.
</li>
</ul>
</p>
</subsection>

<subsection>
<title>Chain Rule Examples</title>

<p>We'll now use the chain rule to compute some more derivatives.
</p>

<example xml:id="eg_DIFFchainA"><title><m>\diff{}{x}\big(1+3x\big)^{75}</m></title>
<p>
Find <m>\diff{}{x}\big(1+3x\big)^{75}</m>.

<p>This is a concrete version of Example <xref ref="eg_DIFFchainaxb"/>.
We are to find the derivative of a function that is built up by first
computing <m>1+3x</m> and then taking the <m>75^{\rm th}</m> power of the result.
So we set
<md>
<mrow>
f(u)&amp;=u^{75} &amp;
f'(u)&amp;=75 u^{74}
</mrow><mrow>
g(x)&amp;=1+3x &amp;

F(x)&amp;=f\big(g(x)\big)=g(x)^{75}=\big(1+3x\big)^{75}

By the chain rule
<md>
<mrow>
F'(x)&amp;= f'\big(g(x)\big)\,g'(x)

<example xml:id="eg_DIFFchainB"><title><m>\diff{}{x}\sin(x^2)</m></title>
<p>
Find <m>\diff{}{x}\sin(x^2)</m>.
</p>

<p>In this example we are to compute the derivative of <m>\sin</m> with a
(slightly) complicated argument. So we apply the chain rule with <m>f</m>
being <m>\sin</m> and <m>g(x)</m> being the complicated argument. That is, we set
<md>
<mrow>
f(u)&amp;=\sin u &amp;

     &amp;= 2x\cos(x^2)

<p>
Find <m>\diff{}{x}\root{3}\of{\sin(x^2)}</m>.
</p>

<p>In this example we are to compute the derivative of the cube root of a
(moderately) complicated argument, namely <m>\sin(x^2)</m>. So we apply
the chain rule with <m>f</m> being <q>cube root</q> and <m>g(x)</m> being the
complicated argument. That is, we set
<md>
<mrow>
f(u)&amp;=\root{3}\of{u}=u^{\tfrac{1}{3}} &amp;
f'(u)&amp;=\tfrac{1}{3}u^{-\tfrac{2}{3}}

</mrow><mrow>
F(x)&amp;=f\big(g(x)\big)=\root{3}\of{g(x)}=\root{3}\of{\sin(x^2)}
</mrow>
</md>
In computing <m>g'(x)</m> here, we have already used the chain rule once
(in Example <xref ref="eg_DIFFchainB"/>).
By the chain rule
<md>
<mrow>
F'(x)&amp;= f'\big(g(x)\big)\,y'(x)
     = \tfrac{1}{3} g(x)^{-\tfrac{2}{3}} \cdot 2x\cos(x^2)

<p>This is very similar to the previous example. Let us set <m>F(x) = f(g(h(x)))</m>
with <m>u=g(h(x))</m> then the chain rule tells us
<md>
<mrow>
\diff{F}{x} &amp;= \diff{f}{u} \cdot \diff{u}{x}

<intertext>We now just apply the chain rule again</intertext><mrow>

Indeed it is not too hard to generalise further (in the manner of

more functions (though things start to become tedious to write down):

<example xml:id="eg_2_9_4"><title>Finding the quotient rule from the chain rule</title>
<p>
 We can also use the chain rule to recover Corollary<nbsp/><xref ref="cor_diff_recip"/> and from there
we can use the product rule to recover the quotient rule.
</p>

<p>We want to differentiate <m>F(x) = \frac{1}{g(x)}</m> so set <m>f(u) = \frac{1}{u}</m> and
<m>u=g(x)</m>. Then the chain rule tells us
<md>
<mrow>
  \diff{}{x} \left\{\frac{1}{g(x)}\right\} = \diff{F}{x}
&amp;= \diff{f}{u} \cdot \diff{u}{x}
</mrow><mrow>
  &amp;= \frac{-1}{u^2} \cdot g'(x)
</mrow><mrow>
  &amp;= -\frac{g'(x)}{g(x)^2}.
</mrow>
</md>
Once we know this, a quick application of the product rule will give us the quotient rule.
<md>
<mrow>
\amp\diff{}{x} \left\{ \frac{f(x)}{g(x)} \right\}

<example xml:id="eg_DIFFchainD"><title>A nice messy example</title>
<p>
Compute the following derivative:
<md>
<mrow>
\diff{}{x}\cos\left(\frac{x^5\sqrt{3+x^6}}{{(4+x^2)}^3}\right)
</mrow>
</md>
</p>

<p>This time we are to compute the derivative of <m>\cos</m> with a really
complicated argument.
<ul>
<li> So, to start, we apply
the chain rule with <m>g(x)=\frac{x^5\sqrt{3+x^6}}{{(4+x^2)}^3}</m>
being the really complicated argument and <m>f</m> being <m>\cos</m>. That is,
<m>f(u)=\cos(u)</m>. Since  <m>f'(u)=-\sin(u)</m>, the chain rule gives
<md>
<mrow>
\diff{}{x}\cos\bigg(\frac{x^5\sqrt{3+x^6}}{{(4+x^2)}^3}\,\bigg)
=-\sin\bigg(\frac{x^5\sqrt{3+x^6}}{{(4+x^2)}^3}\,\bigg)\
\diff{}{x} \left\{\frac{x^5\sqrt{3+x^6}}{{(4+x^2)}^3} \right\}
</mrow>
</md>
</li>
<li> This reduced our problem to that of computing the derivative
of the really complicated argument <m>\tfrac{x^5\sqrt{3+x^6}}{{(4+x^2)}^3}</m>.
We can think of the argument as being built up out of three pieces,
namely <m>x^5</m>, multiplied by <m>\sqrt{3+x^6}</m>, divided by
<m>{(4+x^2)}^3</m>, or, equivalently, multiplied by <m>{(4+x^2)}^{-3}</m>. So we may
rewrite <m>\tfrac{x^5\sqrt{3+x^6}}{{(4+x^2)}^3}</m> as
<m>x^5\,\big(3+x^6\big)^{\frac{1}{2}}\ {(4+x^2)}^{-3}</m>,
and then apply the product rule to reduce the problem to that of computing
the derivatives of the three pieces.
</li>
<li> Here goes (recall Example<nbsp/><xref ref="eg_DIFFsimpleToolsA"/>):
<md>
<mrow>
\diff{}{x}\big[x^5\,{(3+x^6)}^{\frac{1}{2}}\ {(4+x^2)}^{-3}\big]
&amp;=\diff{}{x}\big[x^5\big] \cdot {(3+x^6)}^{\frac{1}{2}}\cdot {(4+x^2)}^{-3}
</mrow><mrow>
&amp;\phantom{=} +x^5\cdot \diff{}{x}\big[{(3+x^6)}^{\frac{1}{2}}\big]
    \cdot {(4+x^2)}^{-3}
</mrow><mrow>
&amp;\phantom{=} +x^5\cdot {(3+x^6)}^{\frac{1}{2}}\cdot
           \diff{}{x}\big[{(4+x^2)}^{-3}\big]
</mrow>
</md>
This has reduced our problem to computing the derivatives of <m>x^5</m>, which
is easy, and of <m>{(3+x^6)}^{\frac{1}{2}}</m> and <m>{(4+x^2)}^{-3}</m>,
both of which can be done by the chain rule. Doing so,
<md>
<mrow>
\diff{}{x}\big[x^5\,{(3+x^6)}^{\frac{1}{2}}\ {(4+x^2)}^{-3}\big]
&amp;=\overbrace{\diff{}{x}\big[x^5\big]}^{5x^4}
     \cdot{(3+x^6)}^{\frac{1}{2}}\cdot {(4+x^2)}^{-3}
</mrow><mrow>
&amp; \phantom{=}+x^5\cdot
    \overbrace{\diff{}{x}\big[{(3+x^6)}^{\frac{1}{2}}\big]}^
                     {\frac{1}{2}(3+x^6)^{-\frac{1}{2}}\cdot 6x^5}
    \cdot {(4+x^2)}^{-3}
</mrow><mrow>
&amp;\phantom{=} +x^5\cdot{(3+x^6)}^{\frac{1}{2}}\cdot
   \overbrace{\diff{}{x}\big[{(4+x^2)}^{-3}\big]}^
      {-3{(4+x^2)}^{-4}\cdot 2x}
</mrow>
</md>
</li>
<li><p> Now we can clean things up in a sneaky way by observing
<ul>
<li> differentiating <m>x^5</m>, to get <m>5x^4</m>, is the same as multiplying <m>x^5</m>
by <m>\frac{5}{x}</m>, and
</li>
<li> differentiating <m>{(3+x^6)}^{\frac{1}{2}}</m> to get
<m>\frac{1}{2}(3+x^6)^{-\frac{1}{2}}\cdot 6x^5</m> is the same as
multiplying <m>{(3+x^6)}^{\frac{1}{2}}</m> by  <m>\frac{3x^5}{3+x^6}</m>, and
</li>
<li> differentiating <m>{(4+x^2)}^{-3}</m> to get  <m>-3{(4+x^2)}^{-4}\cdot 2x</m>
is the same as multiplying <m>{(4+x^2)}^{-3}</m> by <m>-\frac{6x}{4+x^2}</m>.
</li>
</ul>
Using these sneaky tricks we can write our solution quite neatly:
<md>
<mrow>
\amp\diff{}{x}\cos\bigg(\frac{x^5\sqrt{3+x^6}}{{(4+x^2)}^3}\,\bigg)
</mrow><mrow>
\amp=-\sin\bigg(\frac{x^5\sqrt{3+x^6}}{{(4+x^2)}^3}\,\bigg)\
\frac{x^5\sqrt{3+x^6}}{{(4+x^2)}^3}\
\bigg\{\frac{5}{x}+\frac{3x^5}{3+x^6}-\frac{6x}{4+x^2}\bigg\}
</mrow>
</md></p>
</li>
<li> This method of cleaning up the derivative of a messy product is actually something
more systematic in disguise <mdash/> namely logarithmic differentiation. We will come to
this later.
</li>
</ul>
