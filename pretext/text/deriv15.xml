<title>(Optional) --- Is <m>\lim_{x\to c}f'(x)</m> Equal to <m>f'(c)</m>?</title>

<p>
Consider the function
<me>
f(x) = \begin{cases}
            \frac{\sin x^2}{x} \amp\text{if }x\ne 0 \\
             0                  \amp\text{if }x=0
        \end{cases}
</me>
For any <m>x\ne 0</m> we can easily use our differentiation rules to find
<me>
f'(x) = \frac{2x^2\cos x^2 -\sin x^2}{x^2}
</me>
But for <m>x=0</m> none of our usual differentation rules apply. So how do we find <m>f'(0)</m>? One obviously legitimate strategy is to directly apply the 
Definition 2.2.1  of the derivative. As an alternative, we will now consider the question <q>Can one find <m>f'(0)</m> by taking the limit of <m>f'(x)</m> as <m>x</m> tends to zero?</q>.
There is bad news and there is good news.
<ul>
<li>
The bad news is that, even for functions <m>f(x)</m> that are differentiable for all <m>x</m>, <m>f'(x)</m> need not be continuous. That is, it is <em>not</em> always true that 
<m>\lim_{x\rightarrow 0}f'(x) = f'(0)</m>. We will see a function for which 
<m>\lim_{x\rightarrow 0}f'(x) \ne f'(0)</m> in 
Example<nbsp/><xref ref="eg_discontinuous_derivative"/>, below.
</li><li>
The good news is that Theorem<nbsp/><xref ref="thm_continuous_derivative"/>, below 
provides conditions which are sufficient to guarantee that <m>f(x)</m> is differentiable at <m>x=0</m> and that <m>\lim_{x\rightarrow 0}f'(x) = f'(0)</m>.  
</li>
</ul>
</p>

<example xml:id="eg_discontinuous_derivative">
<p>
Consider the function
<me>
f(x) = \begin{cases}
            x^2\sin\frac{1}{x} \amp\text{if }x\ne 0 \\
             0                  \amp\text{if }x=0
        \end{cases}
</me>
For <m>x\ne 0</m> we have, by the product and chain rules,
<md>
<mrow>
f'(x)  \amp= 2x\, \sin\frac{1}{x} + x^2 \left(\cos\frac{1}{x}\right)
                     \left(-\frac{1}{x^2}\right) 
</mrow><mrow>
       \amp=  2x\, \sin\frac{1}{x} - \cos\frac{1}{x}
</mrow>
</md>
As <m>\left|\sin\frac{1}{x}\right|\le 1</m>, we have
<me>
\lim_{x\rightarrow 0}2x\, \sin\frac{1}{x}=0
</me>
On the other hand, as <m>x</m> tends to zero, <m>\frac{1}{x}</m> goes to <m>\pm\infty</m>.
So
<me>
\lim_{x\rightarrow 0}\cos\frac{1}{x} = DNE
\implies 
\lim_{x\rightarrow 0}f'(x) = DNE
</me>
We will now see that, despite this, <m>f'(0)</m> is perfectly well defined.
By definition
<md>
<mrow>
f'(0) \amp= \lim_{h\to 0}\frac{f(h)-f(0)}{h}  
</mrow><mrow>
      \amp = \lim_{h\to 0}\frac{h^2\sin\frac{1}{h}-0}{h} 
</mrow><mrow>
      \amp = \lim_{h\to 0} h\sin\frac{1}{h} 
</mrow><mrow>
      \amp = 0\qquad\text{since }\left|\sin\frac{1}{h}\right|\le 1
</mrow>
</md>
So <m>f'(0)</m> exists, but is not equal to <m>\lim_{x\rightarrow 0}f'(x)</m>,
which does not exist.
</p>
</example>
<p>
Now for the good news.
</p>

<theorem xml:id="thm_continuous_derivative">
<p>
Let <m>a\lt c\lt b</m>. Assume that 
<ul>
<li> 
the function <m>f(x)</m> is continous on the interval <m>a\lt x\lt b</m> and
</li><li>
is differentiable at every <m>x</m> in the intervals <m>a\lt x\lt c</m> 
and <m>c\lt x\lt b</m> and
</li><li>
the limit  <m>\lim_{x\rightarrow c}f'(x)</m> exists.
</li>
</ul>
Then <m>f</m> is differentiable at <m>x=c</m> and
<me>
f'(c) = \lim_{x\rightarrow c}f'(x)
</me>
</p>
</theorem>
<proof>
<p>
By hypothesis, there is a number <m>L</m> such that
<me>
\lim_{x\rightarrow c}f'(x) = L
</me>
By definition
<me>
f'(c) = \lim_{h\to 0}\frac{f(c+h)-f(c)}{h}
</me>
By the Mean Value Theorem  (Theorem <xref ref="thm_DIFFmvt"/> <!-- 2.13.4 -->) 
there is, for each <m>h</m>,
an (unknown) number <m>x_h</m> between <m>c</m> and <m>c+h</m> such that 
<m>f'(x_h)=\frac{f(c+h)-f(c)}{h}</m>. So
<me>
f'(c) = \lim_{h\to 0} f'(x_h)
</me>
As <m>h</m> tends to zero, <m>c+h</m> tends to <m>c</m>, and so  <m>x_h</m> is forced to tend 
to <m>c</m>, and <m>f'(x_h)</m> is forced to tend to <m>L</m> so that
<me>
f'(c) = \lim_{h\to 0} f'(x_h) = L
</me>
</p>
</proof>

<p>
In the next example we evaluate <m>f'(0)</m> by applying 
Theorem <xref ref="thm_continuous_derivative"/>.
</p>
<example xml:id="eg_continuous_derivative">
<p>
Let 
<me>
f(x) = \begin{cases}
            \frac{\sin x^2}{x} \amp\text{if }x\ne 0 \\
             0                 \amp\text{if }x=0
        \end{cases}
</me>
We have already observed above that, for <m>x\ne 0</m>,
<me>
f'(x) = \frac{2x^2\cos x^2 -\sin x^2}{x^2}
      = 2\cos x^2 - \frac{\sin x^2}{x^2}
</me>
We use Theorem <xref ref="thm_continuous_derivative"/> with <m>c=0</m> to show that <m>f(x)</m> is differentiable at <m>x=0</m> and to evaluate <m>f'(0)</m>. That theorem has two hypotheses that we have not yet verified, namely the continuity of <m>f(x)</m> at <m>x=0</m>, and the existence of the limit <m>\lim_{x\rightarrow 0}f'(x)</m>.
We verify them now.
<ul>
<li>
We already know, by Lemma <xref ref="lem_sinhoverh"/>, <!--  2.8.1 -->
that <m>\lim_{h\rightarrow 0}\frac{\sin h}{h}=1</m>. So
<md>
<mrow>
\lim_{x\rightarrow 0}\frac{\sin x^2}{x^2} 
\amp=\lim_{h\rightarrow 0^+}\frac{\sin h}{h}\qquad\text{with }h=x^2
</mrow><mrow>
\amp=1
</mrow>
</md>
and
<md>
<mrow>
\lim_{x\rightarrow 0} f(x) 
\amp=\lim_{x\rightarrow 0}\frac{\sin x^2}{x}
=\lim_{x\rightarrow 0}x\,\frac{\sin x^2}{x^2}
=\lim_{x\rightarrow 0}x\ \lim_{x\rightarrow 0}\frac{\sin x^2}{x^2}
=0\times 1
=0
</mrow>
</md>
and <m>f(x)</m> is continuous at <m>x=0</m>.
</li><li>
The limit of the derivative is
<md>
<mrow>
\lim_{x\rightarrow 0}f'(x) 
\amp= \lim_{x\rightarrow 0}\left[2\cos x^2 - \frac{\sin x^2}{x^2}\right]
=2\times 1 -1 = 1
</mrow>
</md>
</li>
</ul>
So, by Theorem <xref ref="thm_continuous_derivative"/>, <m>f(x)</m> is differentiable 
at <m>x=0</m> and <m>f'(0)=1</m>.
</p>
