<title>Optimisation</title>
<introduction>
<p>
One important application of differential calculus is to find the maximum (or minimum)
value of a function. This often finds real world applications in problems such as the
following.</p>

<example><title>Enclosing a paddock</title>
<p>
A farmer has 400m of fencing materials. What is the largest rectangular paddock
that can be enclosed?
</p>

<p><alert>Solution</alert> We will describe a general approach to these sorts of problems in
Sections<nbsp/><xref ref="ssec_find_maxmin"/> and<nbsp/><xref ref="sec_opt_eg"/> below, but here we can take
a stab at starting the problem.
<ul>
<li> Begin by defining variables and their units (more generally we might draw a
picture too); let the dimensions of the paddock be <m>x</m> by <m>y</m> metres.
</li>
<li> The area enclosed is then <m>A m^2</m> where
<md>
<mrow>
  A &amp;= x \cdot y
</mrow>
</md>
At this stage we cannot apply the calculus we have developed since the area is a function
of two variables and we only know how to work with functions of a single variable. We
need to eliminate one variable.
</li>
<li> We know that the perimeter of the rectangle (and hence the dimensions <m>x</m>
and <m>y</m>) are constrained by the amount of fencing materials the farmer has to
hand:
<md>
<mrow>
  2x+2y &amp;\leq 400
</mrow>
<intertext> and so we have</intertext><mrow>
  y &amp;\leq 200-x
</mrow>
</md>
Clearly the area of the paddock is maximised when we use all the fencing possible, so
<md>
<mrow>
  y = 200-x
</mrow>
</md>
</li>
<li> Now substitute this back into our expression for the area
<md>
<mrow>
  A &amp;= x \cdot (200-x)
</mrow>
</md>
Since the area cannot be negative (and our lengths <m>x,y</m> cannot be negative either), we
must also have
<md>
<mrow>
  0 \leq x \leq 200
</mrow>
</md>
</li>
<li> Thus the question of the largest paddock enclosed becomes the problem of finding
the maximum value of
<md>
<mrow>
  A &amp;= x \cdot (200-x) &amp;\text{ subject to the constraint $0 \leq x \leq 200$.}
</mrow>
</md>
</li>
</ul>
</p></example>

<p>The above example is sufficiently simple that we can likely determine the answer by
several different methods. In general, we will need more systematic methods for solving
problems of the form</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
 Find the maximum value of <m>y = f(x)</m> subject to <m>a \leq x \leq b</m>
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>To do this we need to examine what a function looks like near its
maximum and minimum values.
</p>
</introduction>

<subsection xml:id="ssec_maxmin">
<title>Local and global maxima and minima</title>

<p>We start by asking:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Suppose that the maximum (or minimum) value of <m>f(x)</m> is <m>f(c)</m> then what does that tell
us about <m>c</m>?
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Notice that we have not yet made the ideas of maximum and minimum very precise.
For the moment think of maximum as <q>the biggest value</q> and minimum as
<q>the smallest value</q>.
</p>

<warning>
<statement><p>
It is important to distinguish between <q>the smallest value</q> and <q>the smallest
magnitude</q>. For example, because
<md>
<mrow>
  -5  \lt  -1
</mrow>
</md>
the number <m>-5</m> is smaller than <m>-1</m>. But the magnitude of <m>-1</m>, which is <m>|-1|=1</m>, is
smaller than the magnitude of <m>-5</m>, which is <m>|-5|=5</m>. Thus the smallest number in the set
<m>\{-1, -5\}</m> is <m>-5</m>, while the number in the set <m>\{-1,-5\}</m> that has the smallest
magnitude is <m>-1</m>.
</p></statement>
</warning>

<p>Now back to thinking about what happens around a maximum. Suppose that the maximum value
of <m>f(x)</m> is <m>f(c)</m>, then for all <q>nearby</q> points, the function should be smaller. </p>

<sidebyside width="66%">
 <image source="text/figs/loc_max"/>
</sidebyside>

<p>Consider the derivative of <m>f'(c)</m>:
<md>
<mrow>
f'(c) &amp;= \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{f(c+h)-f(c)}{h}.
</mrow>
</md>
Split the above limit into the left and right limits:
<ul>
<li> Consider points to the right of <m>x=c</m>, For all <m>h \gt 0</m>,
<md>
<mrow>
f(c+h) &amp; \le f(c)  &amp; \text{which implies that}
</mrow><mrow>
f(c+h)-f(c) &amp;\le 0 &amp; \text{which also implies}
</mrow><mrow>
\frac{f(c+h)-f(c)}{h} &amp; \le 0 &amp; \text{since }
\frac{\text{negative}}{\text{positive}} = \text{negative}.
</mrow>
</md>
But now if we squeeze <m>h \to 0</m> we get
<md>
<mrow>
  \lim_{h \to 0^+} \frac{f(c+h)-f(c)}{h} &amp;\leq 0
</mrow>
</md>
(provided the limit exists).
</li>
<li> Consider points to the left of <m>x=c</m>. For all <m>h \lt 0</m>,
<md>
<mrow>
f(c+h) &amp; \le f(c)  &amp; \text{which implies that}
</mrow><mrow>
f(c+h)-f(c) &amp;\le 0 &amp; \text{which also implies}
</mrow><mrow>
\frac{f(c+h)-f(c)}{h} &amp; \ge 0 &amp; \text{since }
\frac{\text{negative}}{\text{negative}} = \text{positive}.
</mrow>
</md>
But now if we squeeze <m>h \to 0</m> we get
<md>
<mrow>
  \lim_{h \to 0^-} \frac{f(c+h)-f(c)}{h} &amp;\geq 0
</mrow>
</md>
(provided the limit exists).
</li>
<li> So if the derivative <m>f'(c)</m> exists, then the above right- and left-hand
limits must agree, which forces <m>f'(c) = 0</m>.
</li>
</ul>
Thus we can conclude that</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
 If the maximum value of <m>f(x)</m> is <m>f(c)</m> and <m>f'(c)</m> exists, then <m>f'(c)=0</m>.
</p></blockquote>

<p>Using similar reasoning one can also see that</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
 If the minimum value of <m>f(x)</m> is <m>f(c)</m> and <m>f'(c)</m> exists, then <m>f'(c)=0</m>.
</p></blockquote>

<p>Notice two things about the above reasoning:
<ul>
<li>  Firstly, in order for the argument to work we
only need that <m>f(x) \lt f(c)</m> for <m>x</m> close to <m>c</m> <mdash/> it does not matter what happens for
<m>x</m> values far from <m>c</m>.
</li>
<li> Secondly, in the above argument we needed to consider <m>f(x)</m> for <m>x</m> both
to the left of and to the right of <m>c</m>. If the function <m>f(x)</m> is defined on a
closed interval <m>[a,b]</m>, then the above argument only applies when <m>a \lt c \lt b</m> <mdash/>
not when <m>c</m> is either of the endpoints <m>a</m> and <m>b</m>.
</li>
</ul>
Consider the function below
</p>
<sidebyside width="66%">
<image source="text/figs/maxmin"/>
</sidebyside>
<p>
This function has only 1 maximum value (the middle green point in the graph) and
1 minimum value (the rightmost blue point), however it has 4 points at which the
derivative is zero. In the small intervals around those points where the
derivative is zero, we can see that function is <em>locally</em> a maximum or
minimum, even if it is not the <em>global</em> maximum or minimum. We clearly need
to be more careful distinguishing between these cases.
</p>

<definition xml:id="def_APPlocalMaxMin">
<statement><p>
Let <m>a\le b</m> and let the function <m>f(x)</m> be defined for all <m>x \in [a,b]</m>. Now
let <m>a \leq c \leq b</m>, then
<ul>
<li> We say that <m>f(x)</m> has a global (or absolute)
minimum at <m>x=c</m> if <m>f(x)\ge f(c)</m> for all <m>a\le x\le b</m>.
</li>
<li> Similarly, we say that <m>f(x)</m> has a global (or absolute)
maximum at <m>x=c</m> if <m>f(x)\le f(c)</m> for all <m>a\le x\le b</m>.
</li>
</ul>
Now let <m>a  \lt  c  \lt b</m> (note the strict inequalities), then
<ul>
<li> We say that <m>f(x)</m> has a local minimum at <m>x=c</m>
if there are <m>a'</m> and <m>b'</m> obeying <m>a\le a' \lt c \lt b'\le b</m> such that
<m>f(x)\ge f(c)</m> for all <m>x</m> obeying <m>a' \lt x \lt b'</m>.  Note the <em>strict</em>
inequalities in <m>a' \lt c \lt b'</m>.
</li>
<li> Similarly, we say that <m>f(x)</m> has a local maximum at <m>x=c</m>
if there are <m>a'</m> and <m>b'</m> obeying <m>a\le a' \lt c \lt b'\le b</m> such that
<m>f(x)\le f(c)</m> for all <m>x</m> obeying <m>a' \lt x \lt b'</m>.  Note the <em>strict</em>
inequalities in <m>a' \lt c \lt b'</m>.
</li>
</ul>
The global maxima and minima of a function are called the
global extrema of the function, while the local maxima and minima are called the local
extrema.
</p></statement>
</definition>

<p>Consider again the function we showed in the figure above</p>
<sidebyside width="66%">
 <image source="text/figs/maxmin2"/>
 </sidebyside>
<p>It has 2 local maxima and 2 local minima. The global maximum occurs at the middle green
point (which is also a local maximum), while the global minimum occurs at the rightmost
blue point (which is not a local minimum).
</p>

<p>Using the above definition we can summarise what we have learned above
as the following theorem
<fn>This is one of several important mathematical contributions made by Pierre
de Fermat, a French government lawyer and amateur mathematician, who lived in the first half of
the seventeenth century.
</fn>:</p>

<theorem xml:id="thm_APPlocalMaxMin">
<statement><p>
If a function <m>f(x)</m> has a local maximum or local minimum at <m>x=c</m>
and if <m>f'(c)</m> exists, then <m>f'(c)=0</m>.
</p></statement>
</theorem>

<p>
<ul>
<li>
It is often (but not always) the case that, when <m>f(x)</m> has a local maximum
at <m>x=c</m>, the function <m>f(x)</m> increases strictly as <m>x</m> approaches <m>c</m> from the
left and decreases strictly as <m>x</m> leaves <m>c</m> to the right. That is,
<m>f'(x) \gt 0</m> for <m>x</m> just to the left of <m>c</m> and <m>f'(x) \lt 0</m> for <m>x</m> just
to the right of <m>c</m>. Then, it is often the case, because <m>f'(x)</m> is decreasing as <m>x</m>
increases through <m>c</m>, that <m>f''(c) \lt 0</m>.
</li>
<li>
Conversely, if <m>f'(c)=0</m> and <m>f''(c) \lt 0</m>,
  then, just to the right of <m>c</m> <m>f'(x)</m> must be negative, so that
  <m>f(x)</m> is decreasing, and  just to the left of <m>c</m> <m>f'(x)</m> must
  be positive, so that <m>f(x)</m> is increasing.
  So <m>f(x)</m> has a local maximum at <m>c</m>.
</li>
<li>
 Similarly, it is often the case that, when <m>f(x)</m> has a local minimum
 at <m>x=c</m>, <m>f'(x) \lt 0</m> for <m>x</m> just to the left of <m>c</m> and <m>f'(x) \gt 0</m> for
 <m>x</m> just to the right of <m>c</m> and <m>f''(x) \gt 0</m>.
</li>
<li>
Conversely, if <m>f'(c)=0</m> and <m>f''(c) \gt 0</m>,
  then, just to the right of <m>c</m> <m>f'(x)</m> must be positive, so that
  <m>f(x)</m> is increasing, and, just to the left of <m>c</m> <m>f'(x)</m> must be
  negative, so that <m>f(x)</m> is decreasing.
  So <m>f(x)</m> has a local minimum at <m>c</m>.
</li>
</ul>
</p>

<theorem xml:id="thm_APPsecondDerivTest">
<statement><p>
If <m>f'(c)=0</m> and <m>f''(c)  \lt 0</m>, then <m>f(x)</m> has a local maximum at <m>c</m>.
</p>

<p>If <m>f'(c)=0</m> and <m>f''(c)  \gt 0</m>, then <m>f(x)</m> has a local minimum at <m>c</m>.
</p>

<p><em>Note the strict inequalities</em>.
</p>

</statement>
</theorem>

<p>Theorem<nbsp/><xref ref="thm_APPlocalMaxMin"/> says that, when <m>f(x)</m> has a local maximum or
minimum at <m>x=c</m>, there are two possibilities.
<ul>
<li><p> The derivative <m>f'(c)=0</m>. This case is illustrated in the following
figure.</p>
<sidebyside width="80%">
 <image source="text/figs/localMaxMinFG"/>
</sidebyside>
<p>
Observe that, in this example, <m>f'(x)</m> changes discontinuously from negative to
positive at the local minimum (<m>x=0</m>) and <m>f'(0)</m> does not exist.</p>
</li>
</ul>
This theorem demonstrates that the points at which the derivative is zero or
does not exist are very important. It simplifies the discussion that follows if
we give these points names.</p>

<definition xml:id="def_APPcriticalPoint">
<statement><p>
Let <m>f(x)</m> be a function and let <m>c</m> be a point in its domain. Then
<ul>
<li> if <m>f'(c)</m> exists and is zero we call <m>x=c</m> a critical point of the
function, and
</li>
<li> if <m>f'(c)</m> does not exist then we call <m>x=c</m> a singular point of the
function.
</li>
</ul>
</p></statement>
</definition>

<warning><statement><p>
Note that some people (and texts) will combine both of these cases and call
<m>x=c</m> a critical point when either the derivative is zero or does not exist.
The reader should be aware of the lack of convention on this point
<fn>No
pun intended.</fn>
 and should be careful to understand whether the more inclusive
definition of critical point is being used, or if the text is using the more
precise definition that distinguishes critical and singular points.
</p>
</statement>
</warning>

<p>We'll now look at a few simple examples involving local maxima and
minima, critical points and singular points. Then we will move on to global
maxima and minima.</p>

<example xml:id="eg_localMinMaxA"><title>Local max and min of <m>x^3-6x</m></title>
<p>
In this example, we'll look for local maxima and minima of the function
<m>f(x) = x^3-6x</m> on the interval <m>-2\le x\le 3</m>.
<ul>
<li> First compute the derivative
<md>
<mrow>
  f'(x) &amp;= 3x^2-6.
</mrow>
</md>
Since this is a polynomial it is defined everywhere on the domain and so there
will not be any singular points. So we now look for critical points.
</li>
<li><p> To do so we look for zeroes of the derivative
<md>
<mrow>
  f'(x) &amp;= 3x^2-6 = 3(x^2-2) = 3(x-\sqrt{2})(x+\sqrt{2}).
</mrow>
</md>
This derivative takes the value <m>0</m> at two different values of <m>x</m>. Namely
<m>x=c_-=-\sqrt{2}</m> and <m>x=c_+=\sqrt{2}</m>. Here is a sketch of the graph of
<m>f(x)</m>.</p>

<sidebyside width="80%">
<image source="text/figs/localMaxMinA"/>
</sidebyside>

<p> From the figure we see that
<ul>
<li> <m>f(x)</m> has a local minimum at <m>x=c_+</m> (i.e. we have <m>f(x)\ge f(c_+)</m>
whenever <m>x</m> is close to <m>c_+</m>) and
</li>
<li> <m>f(x)</m> has a local maximum at <m>x=c_-</m> (i.e. we have <m>f(x)\le f(c_-)</m>
whenever <m>x</m> is close to <m>c_-</m>) and
</li>
<li> the global minimum of <m>f(x)</m>, for <m>x</m> in the interval <m>-2\le x\le 3</m>, is
at <m>x=c_+</m> (i.e. we have <m>f(x)\ge f(c_+)</m> whenever <m>-2\le x\le 3</m>) and
</li>
<li> the global maximum of <m>f(x)</m>, for <m>x</m> in the interval <m>-2\le x\le 3</m>, is
at <m>x=3</m> (i.e. we have <m>f(x)\le f(3)</m> whenever <m>-2\le x\le 3</m>).
</li>
</ul>
</p></li>
<li> Note that we have carefully constructed this example to illustrate that
the global maximum (or minimum) of a function on an interval may or may not also
be a local maximum (or minimum) of the function.
</li>
</ul>
</p>

</example>

<example xml:id="eg_localMinMaxB"><title>Local max and min of <m>x^3</m></title>
<p>
In this example, we'll look for local maxima and minima of the function
<m>f(x) = x^3</m> on the interval <m>-1\le x\le 1</m>.
<ul>
<li> First compute the derivative:
<md>
<mrow>
  f'(x) &amp;= 3x^2.
</mrow>
</md>
Again, this is a polynomial and so defined on all of the domain. The function
will not have singular points, but may have critical points.
</li>
<li> The derivative is zero only when <m>x=0</m>, so <m>x=c=0</m> is the only critical
point of the function.
</li>
<li><p> The graph of <m>f(x)</m> is sketched below. From that sketch we see that <m>f(x)</m>
has <em>neither</em> a local maximum <em>nor</em> a local minimum at <m>x=c</m> despite
the fact that <m>f'(c)=0</m> <mdash/> we have <m>f(x) \lt f(c)=0</m> for all <m>x \lt c=0</m> and
<m>f(x) \gt f(c)=0</m> for all <m>x \gt c=0</m>.</p>

</li>
<li> Note that this example has been constructed to illustrate that a critical
point (or singular point) of a function <em>need not be a local maximum or

that, <q>if <m>f(x)</m> has a local maximum/minimum at <m>x=c</m> and if <m>f</m> is differentiable at

singular points when we look for maxima and minima.

<subsection xml:id="ssec_find_maxmin">
<title>Finding global maxima and minima</title>
<p>
We now have a technique for finding local maxima and minima <mdash/> just look
for values of <m>x</m> for which either <m>f'(x)=0</m> or <m>f'(x)</m> does not exist.
What about finding global maxima and minima? We'll start by stating
explicitly that, under appropriate hypotheses, global maxima
and minima are guaranteed to exist.</p>

<theorem xml:id="thm_APPglobalMaxMinExist">
<statement><p>
Let the function <m>f(x)</m> be defined and continuous on the closed,
finite interval
<fn>The hypotheses that <m>f(x)</m> be continuous
and that the interval be finite and closed are all essential.
We suggest that you find three functions <m>f_1(x)</m>, <m>f_2(x)</m> and
<m>f_3(x)</m> with <m>f_1</m> defined but not continous on <m>0\le x\le 1</m>,
<m>f_2</m> defined and continuous on <m>-\infty \lt x \lt \infty</m>, and <m>f_3</m> defined
and continuous on <m>0 \lt x \lt 1</m>, and with none of <m>f_1</m>, <m>f_2</m> and <m>f_3</m>
attaining either a global maximum or a global minimum.</fn>
</p>

<p><m>-\infty \lt a\le x\le b \lt \infty</m>. Then <m>f(x)</m> attains
a maximum and a minimum at least once. That is, there exist
numbers <m>a\le x_m, x_M\le b</m> such that
<md>
<mrow>
f(x_m)\le f(x)\le f(x_M)
\qquad\text{for all }a\le x\le b
</mrow>
</md>
</p></statement>
</theorem>

<p>So let's again consider the question</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
Suppose that the maximum (or minimum) value of <m>f(x)</m>, for <m>a\le x\le b</m>, is <m>f(c)</m>.
What does that tell us about <m>c</m>?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If <m>c</m> obeys <m>a \lt c \lt b</m> (note the strict inequalities), then <m>f</m> has
a local maximum (or minimum) at <m>x=c</m> and Theorem  <xref ref="thm_APPlocalMaxMin"/>
tells us that either <m>f'(c)=0</m> or <m>f'(c)</m> does not exist. The only other place that a
maximum or minimum can occur are at the ends of the interval. We can summarise this as:</p>

<theorem xml:id="thm_APPglobalMaxMin">

If <m>f(x)</m> has a global maximum or global minimum, for <m>a\le x\le b</m>,
at <m>x=c</m> then there are 3 possibilities. Either
<ul>
<li> <m>f'(c)=0</m>, or
</li>
<li> <m>f'(c)</m> does not exist, or
</li>
<li> <m>c=a</m> or <m>c=b</m>.
</li>
</ul>
That is, a global maximum or minimum must occur either at a critical point, a singular
point or at the endpoints of the interval.
</p></statement>
</theorem>

<p>This theorem provides the basis for a method to find the maximum and
minimum values of <m>f(x)</m> for <m>a\le x\le b</m>:</p>

<corollary xml:id="cor_find_maxmin">
<statement><p>
 Let <m>f(x)</m> be a function on the interval <m>a \leq x \leq b</m>. Then to find the global
maximum and minimum of the function:
<ul>
<li><p> Make a list of all values of <m>c</m>, with <m>a\le c\le b</m>, for which
<ul>
<li> <m>f'(c)=0</m>, or

<li> <m>f'(c)</m> does not exist, or
</li>
<li> <m>c=a</m> or <m>c=b</m>.

That is <mdash/> compute the function at all the critical points, singular points, and
endpoints.
</p></li>
<li> Evaluate <m>f(c)</m> for each <m>c</m> in that list. The largest (or smallest)
      of those values is the largest (or smallest) value of <m>f(x)</m>
      for <m>a\le x\le b</m>.
</li>
</ul>
</p></statement>
</corollary>

<p>Let's now demonstrate how to use this strategy. The function in  this first example is
not too simple <mdash/> but it is a good example of a function that contains both a
singular point and a critical point.</p>

<example xml:id="APPglobalMaxMinA"><title>Find max and min of <m>2x^{5/3}+3x^{2/3}</m></title>

</p>

<p><alert>Solution</alert> We will apply the method in Corollary<nbsp/><xref ref="cor_find_maxmin"/>. It is perhaps easiest
to find the values at the endpoints of the intervals and then move on to the values at
any critical or singular points.
<ul>
<li> Before we get into things, notice that we can rewrite the function by factoring
it:
<md>
<mrow>
  f(x) &amp;= 2x^{5/3}+3x^{2/3} = x^{2/3} \cdot \left(2x + 3\right)
</mrow>
</md>
</li>
<li> Let's compute the function at the endpoints of the interval:
<md>
<mrow>
  f(1) &amp;= 2 +3 = 5
</mrow><mrow>
  f(-1) &amp;= 2 \cdot(-1)^{5/3} + 3\cdot (-1)^{2/3} =-2 + 3 = 1
</mrow>
</md>
</li>
<li> To compute the function at the critical and singular points we first need to find
the derivative:
<md>
<mrow>
  f'(x) &amp;= 2 \cdot \frac{5}{3} x^{2/3} + 3 \cdot \frac{2}{3} x^{-1/3}
</mrow><mrow>
  &amp;= \frac{10}{3} x^{2/3} + 2 x^{-1/3}
</mrow><mrow>
  &amp;= \frac{10 x + 6}{x^{1/3}}
</mrow>
</md>
</li>
<li> Notice that the numerator and denominator are defined for all <m>x</m>. The only place
the derivative is undefined is when the denominator is zero. Hence the only singular
point is at <m>x=0</m>. The corresponding function value is
<md>
<mrow>
  f(0) &amp;= 0
</mrow>
</md>
</li>
<li> To find the critical points we need to solve <m>f'(x) = 0</m>:
<md>
<mrow>
  0 &amp;= \frac{10 x + 6}{x^{1/3}}
</mrow>
</md>
Hence we must have <m>10x=-6</m> or <m>x=-3/5</m>. The corresponding function value is
<md>
<mrow>
  f(x) &amp;= x^{2/3} \cdot \left(2x + 3\right) &amp; \text{recall this from above, then}
</mrow><mrow>
  f(-3/5) &amp;= (-3/5)^{2/3} \cdot\left(2 \cdot \frac{-3}{5} + 3 \right)
</mrow><mrow>
  &amp;= \left(\frac{9}{25}\right)^{1/3} \cdot \frac{-6 + 15}{5}
</mrow><mrow>
  &amp;= \left(\frac{9}{25}\right)^{1/3} \cdot \frac{9}{5}  \approx 1.28
</mrow>
</md>
Note that if we do not want to approximate the root (if, for example, we do not have a
calculator handy), then we can also write
<md>
<mrow>
  f(-3/5) &amp;= \left(\frac{9}{25}\right)^{1/3} \cdot \frac{9}{5}

  &amp;= \left(\frac{9}{25}\right)^{1/3} \cdot \frac{9}{25} \cdot 5
</mrow><mrow>
  &amp;= 5 \cdot \left( \frac{9}{25} \right)^{4/3}
</mrow>
</md>
Since <m>0 \lt 9/25 \lt 1</m>, we know that <m>0  \lt  \left( \frac{9}{25} \right)^{4/3}  \lt  1</m>, and hence

<title>Max/min examples</title>
<p>
As noted at the beginning of this section, the problem of finding maxima and minima is
a very important application of differential calculus in the real world. We now turn to a
number of examples of this process. But to guide the reader we will describe a general
procedure to follow for these problems.
</p>

<p>
<ol label="1">
<li> Read <mdash/> read the problem carefully. Work out what information is given in the
statement of the problem and what we are being asked to compute.
</li>
<li> Diagram <mdash/> draw a diagram. This will typically help you to identify what you know
about the problem and what quantities you need to work out.
</li>
<li> Variables <mdash/> assign variables to the quantities in the problem along
with their units. It is typically a good idea to make sensible choices of variable names:
<m>A</m> for area, <m>h</m> for height, <m>t</m> for time etc.
</li>
<li> Relations <mdash/> find relations between the variables. By now you should know the
quantity we are interested in (the one we want to maximise or minimise) and we
need to establish a relation between it and the other variables.
</li>
<li> Reduce <mdash/> the relation down to a function of one variable. In order to apply the
calculus we know, we must have a function of a single variable. To do this we need to use
all the information we have to eliminate variables. We should also work out
the domain of the resulting function.
</li>
<li> Maximise or minimise <mdash/> we can now apply the methods of Corollary<nbsp/><xref ref="cor_find_maxmin"/>
to find the maximum or minimum of the quantity we need (as the problem dictates).
</li>
<li> Be careful <mdash/> make sure your answer makes sense. Make sure quantities are
physical. For example, lengths and areas cannot be negative.
</li>
<li> Answer the question <mdash/> be sure your answer really answers the question asked in
the problem.
</li>
</ol>
</p>

<p>Let us start with a relatively simple problem:</p>

<example xml:id="APPglobalMaxMinB"><title>Constructing a container of maximal volume</title>
<p>
A closed rectangular container with a square base is to be made
from two different materials. The material for the base costs <dollar />5 per square
meter, while the material for the other five sides costs <dollar />1 per square
meter. Find the dimensions of the container which has the largest possible
volume if the total cost of materials is <dollar />72.
</p>

<p><alert>Solution</alert> We can follow the steps we outlined above to find the solution.
<ul>
<li> We need to determine the area of the two types of materials used and the
corresponding total cost.
</li>
<li><p> Draw a picture of the box.</p>
<sidebyside width="90%">
 <image source="text/figs/container"/>
</sidebyside>

<p>The more useful picture is the unfolded box on the right.</p>
</li>
<li> In the picture we have already introduced two variables. The square base has
side-length <m>b</m> metres and it has height <m>h</m> metres. Let the area of the base be <m>A_b</m>
and the area of the other fives sides be <m>A_s</m> (both in <m>m^2</m>), and the total cost be
<m>C</m> (in dollars). Finally let the volume enclosed be <m>V m^3</m>.
</li>
<li> Some simple geometry tells us that
<md>
<mrow>
  A_b &amp;= b^2
</mrow><mrow>
  A_s &amp;= 4 bh + b^2
</mrow><mrow>
  V &amp;= b^2h
</mrow><mrow>
  C &amp;= 5 \cdot A_b + 1\cdot A_s = 5b^2+4bh+b^2 = 6b^2+4bh.
</mrow>
</md>
</li>
<li> To eliminate one of the variables we use the fact that the total cost is <dollar />72.
<md>
<mrow>
  C &amp;= 6b^2+4bh = 72 &amp; \text{rearrange}
</mrow><mrow>
  4bh &amp;= 72-6b^2  &amp; \text{isolate } h
</mrow><mrow>
  h &amp;= \frac{72-6b^2}{4b} = \frac{3}{2} \cdot \frac{12-b^2}{b}
</mrow>
</md>
Substituting this into the volume gives
<md>
<mrow>
  V&amp;= b^2 h = \frac{3b}{2} (12-b^2) = 18b - \frac{3}{2} b^3
</mrow>
</md>
Now note that since <m>b</m> is a length it cannot be negative, so <m>b \geq 0</m>. Further since
volume cannot be negative, we must also have
<md>
<mrow>
  12-b^2 \geq 0
</mrow>
</md>
and so <m>b \leq \sqrt{12}</m>.
</li>
<li> Now we can apply Corollary<nbsp/><xref ref="cor_find_maxmin"/> on the above expression for
the volume with <m>0 \leq b \leq \sqrt{12}</m>. The endpoints give:
<md>
<mrow>
  V(0) &amp;= 0
</mrow><mrow>
  V(\sqrt{12}) &amp;= 0
</mrow>
</md>
The derivative is
<md>
<mrow>
  V'(b) &amp;= 18 - \frac{9b^2}{2}
</mrow>
</md>
Since this is a polynomial there are no singular points. However we can solve <m>V'(b) = 0</m>
to find critical points:
<md>
<mrow>
  18 - \frac{9b^2}{2} &amp;= 0  &amp; \text{divide by 9 and multiply by 2}
</mrow><mrow>
  4 - b^2 &amp;= 0
</mrow>
</md>
Hence <m>b = \pm 2</m>. Thus the only critical point in the domain is <m>b=2</m>. The corresponding
volume is
<md>
<mrow>
V(2) &amp;= 18\times2 - \frac{3}{2} \times 2^3
</mrow><mrow>
  &amp;= 36 - 12 = 24.
</mrow>
</md>
So by Corollary<nbsp/><xref ref="cor_find_maxmin"/>, the maximum volume is when 24 when <m>b=2</m> and
<md>
<mrow>
  h &amp;= \frac{3}{2} \cdot \frac{12-b^2}{b} = \frac{3}{2} \frac{12-4}{2} = 6.
</mrow>
</md>
</li>
<li> All our quantities make sense; lengths, areas and volumes are all non-negative.
</li>
<li><p> Checking the question again, we see that we are asked for the dimensions of the
container (rather than its volume) so we can answer with</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
 The container with dimensions <m>2 \times 2 \times 6m</m> will be the largest possible.
</p>
</blockquote>

</li>
</ul>
</p></example>

<example xml:id="APPglobalMaxMinC"><title>Constructing another box</title>
<p>
A rectangular sheet of cardboard is 6 inches by 9 inches. Four
identical squares are cut from the corners of the cardboard, as shown in
the figure below, and the remaining piece is folded into an open
rectangular box. What should the size of the cut out squares be in
order to maximize the volume of the box?
</p>

<p><alert>Solution</alert> This one is quite similar to the previous one, so we perhaps don't need to go into
so much detail.
<ul>
<li><p> After reading carefully we produce the following picture:</p>

<sidebyside width="50%">
<image source="text/figs/box_vol"/>
</sidebyside>
</li>
<li> Let the height of the box be <m>x</m> inches, and the base be <m>\ell \times w</m> inches.
The volume of the box is then <m>V</m> cubic inches.
</li>
<li> Some simple geometry tells us that <m>\ell = 9-2x, w=6-2x</m> and so
<md>
<mrow>
V &amp;= x(9-2x)(6-2x) \text{cubic inches}
</mrow><mrow>
  &amp;= 54x-30x^2+4x^3.
</mrow>
</md>
Notice that since all lengths must be non-negative, we must have
<md>
<mrow>
  x,\ell,w \geq 0
</mrow>
</md>
and so <m>0 \leq x \leq 3</m> (if <m>x \gt 3</m> then <m>w \lt 0</m>).
</li>
<li><p> We can now apply Corollary<nbsp/><xref ref="cor_find_maxmin"/>. First the endpoints of the
interval give
<md>
<mrow>
  V(0) &amp;= 0 &amp; V(3) &amp;= 0
</mrow>
</md>
The derivative is
<md>
<mrow>
  V'(x) &amp;= 54 - 60x +12x^2
</mrow><mrow>
  &amp;= 6(9-10x+2x^2)
</mrow>
</md>
Since this is a polynomial there are no singular points. To find critical points we solve
<m>V'(x) = 0</m> to get
<md>
<mrow>
  x_\pm &amp;= \frac{10 \pm \sqrt{100 - 4\times2\times9}}{4}
</mrow><mrow>
  &amp;= \frac{10 \pm \sqrt{28}}{4} = \frac{10 \pm 2\sqrt{7}}{4} = \frac{5 \pm \sqrt{7}}{2}
</mrow>
</md>
We can then use a calculator to approximate
<md>
<mrow>
  x_+ &amp;\approx 3.82 &amp; x_- &amp;\approx 1.18.
</mrow>
</md>
So <m>x_-</m> is inside the domain, while <m>x_+</m> lies outside.
</p>

<p>Alternatively
<fn>Say if we do not have a calculator to hand, or your instructor
insists that the problem be done without one.</fn>
, we can bound <m>x_\pm</m> by first noting that
<m>2 \leq \sqrt{7} \leq 3</m>. From this we know that
<md>
<mrow>
  1=\frac{5-3}{2} &amp; \leq x_- = \frac{5 - \sqrt{7}}{2} \leq \frac{5-2}{2} = 1.5
</mrow><mrow>
  3.5=\frac{5+2}{2} &amp; \leq x_+ = \frac{5 + \sqrt{7}}{2} \leq \frac{5+3}{2} = 4
</mrow>
</md>
</p>
</li>
<li> Since the volume is zero when <m>x=0,3</m>, it must be the case that the volume is
maximised when <m>x = x_- = \frac{5 - \sqrt{7}}{2}</m>.
</li>
<li> Notice that since <m>0  \lt  x_-  \lt 3</m> we know that the other lengths are positive, so our
answer makes sense. Further, the question only asks for the length <m>x</m> and not the
resulting volume so we have answered the question.
</li>
</ul>
</p>
</example>

<p>There is a new wrinkle in the next two examples. Each involves finding the
minimum value of a function <m>f(x)</m> with <m>x</m> running over all real numbers,
rather than just over a finite interval as in Corollary<nbsp/><xref ref="cor_find_maxmin"/>.
Both in Example<nbsp/><xref ref="APPglobalMaxMinD"/> and in Example<nbsp/><xref ref="APPglobalMaxMinDist"/>
the function <m>f(x)</m> tends to <m>+\infty</m> as <m>x</m> tends to either <m>+\infty</m> or
<m>-\infty</m>. So the minimum value of <m>f(x)</m> will be achieved for some finite value
of <m>x</m>, which will be a local minimum as well as a global minimum.
</p>

<theorem xml:id="thm_maxMinOnR">

<li> Some notation is already given to us. Let a point on the line have coordinates
<m>(x,y)</m>, and we do not need units. And let <m>\ell</m> be the distance from the point <m>(x,y)</m>

  \ell^2 &amp;= (x-7)^2 + (y-5)^2

</li>
<li><p> We can now apply Theorem<nbsp/><xref ref="thm_maxMinOnR"/>
<ul>
<li> Since the distance is defined for all real <m>x</m>, we do not have to check the
endpoints of the domain <mdash/> there are none.
</li>
<li> Form the derivative:
<md>
<mrow>
  \diff{\ell}{x} &amp;= \sqrt{10} \frac{2x-2}{2\sqrt{x^2-2x+5}}
</mrow>
</md>
It is zero when <m>x=1</m>, and undefined if <m>x^2-2x+5 \lt 0</m>. However, since
<md>
<mrow>
  x^2-2x+5 &amp;= (x^2-2x+1)+4 = \underbrace{(x-1)^2}_{\geq0}+4
</mrow>
</md>
we know that <m>x^2-2x+5 \geq 4</m>. Thus the function has no singular points and the only
critical point occurs at <m>x=1</m>. The corresponding function value is then
<md>
<mrow>
  \ell(1) &amp;=\sqrt{10} \sqrt{1-2+5} = 2 \sqrt{10}.

</li>
<li> Thus the minimum value of the distance is <m>\ell=2\sqrt{10}</m> and occurs at <m>x=1</m>.
</li>
</ul>
</p>
</li>
<li> This answer makes sense <mdash/> the distance is not negative.

<li><p> The question asks for the point that minimises the distance, not that minimum

<p>
 The point that minimises the distance is <m>(1,3)</m>.

</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>Notice that we can make the analysis easier by observing that the point that minimises
the distance also minimises the squared-distance. So that instead of minimising the

<md>
<mrow>
  \ell^2 &amp;= 10(x^2-2x+5)

The resulting algebra is a bit easier and we don't have to hunt for singular points.

As noted in the previous problem, we will minimise the squared-distance since that also

  \ell^2 &amp;= (x-2)^2 + y^2 = (x-2)^2 + (x^2+1)
</mrow>
</md>
Notice that as <m>x \to \pm \infty</m> the squared-distance <m>\ell^2 \to +\infty</m>.
</li>
<li> Since the squared-distance is a polynomial it will not have any singular points,
only critical points. The derivative is

<mrow>
  \diff{}{x} \ell^2 &amp;= 2(x-2) + 2x = 4x-4

<p>This next one is a good physics example. In it we will derive Snell's

<fn>Snell's law is named after the Dutch astronomer Willebrord Snellius
who derived it in around 1621, though it was first stated accurately in 984 by
Ibn Sahl.</fn>
 from Fermat's principle
<fn>Named after Pierre de Fermat who
described it in a letter in 1662. The beginnings of the idea, however, go back
as far as Hero of Alexandria in around 60CE. Hero is credited with many
inventions including the first vending machine, and a precursor of the steam
engine called an aeolipile.</fn>

<p>Let <m>c_a</m> be the speed of light in air and <m>c_w</m> be the speed of

<ul>
<li><p> We are given a figure in the statement of the problem and it contains

<li> The statement of Snell's law contains terms <m>\sin \theta_i</m> and <m>\sin

Notice that the terms inside the square-roots cannot be zero or negative since

<md>
<mrow>
  \diff{\ell}{\theta} &amp;= -\frac{3 \cos\theta}{\sin^2\theta} +
\frac{2\sin\theta}{\cos^2\theta}
  = \frac{-3\cos^3\theta  +2 \sin^3\theta}{\sin^2\theta
\cos^2\theta}.
</mrow>
</md>
This does not exist at <m>\theta = 0, \frac{\pi}{2}</m> (which we have already
analysed) but does exist at every <m>0  \lt \theta \lt  \frac{\pi}{2}</m> and is equal to zero when the
numerator is zero. Namely when
<md>
<mrow>
  2\sin^3\theta &amp;= 3 \cos^3 \theta &amp; \text{divide by $\cos^3 \theta$}
</mrow><mrow>
  2 \tan^3\theta &amp;= 3
</mrow><mrow>
  \tan\theta &amp;= \sqrt[3]{\frac{3}{2}}

<li> <p> From this we can recover <m>sin\theta</m> and  <m>cos\theta</m>, without having to compute <m>\theta</m> itself. We can, for example, construct a right-angle triangle with adjacent length
<m>\sqrt[3]{2}</m> and opposite length <m>\sqrt[3]{3}</m> (so that <m>\tan\theta=\sqrt[3]{3/2}</m>):</p>

<p>It has hypotenuse <m>\sqrt{ 3^{2/3} + 2^{2/3}}</m>, and so
<md>
<mrow>
  \sin \theta &amp;= \frac{3^{1/3}}{\sqrt{3^{2/3}+2^{2/3}}}
</mrow><mrow>
  \cos \theta &amp;= \frac{2^{1/3}}{\sqrt{3^{2/3}+2^{2/3}}}
</mrow>
</md>
Alternatively could use the identities:
<md>
<mrow>
  1 + \tan^2\theta &amp;= \sec^2\theta &amp; 1+\cot^2\theta &amp;= \csc^2\theta
</mrow>
</md>
to obtain expressions for <m>1/\cos\theta</m> and <m>1/\sin\theta</m>.</p>
</li>
<li> Using the above expressions for <m>\sin\theta, \cos\theta</m> we find the minimum of
<m>\ell</m> (which is the longest rod that we can move):
<md>
<mrow>
  \ell &amp;= \frac{3}{\sin\theta} + \frac{2}{\cos\theta}
=\frac{3}{ \frac{\root 3\of 3}
         {\sqrt{2^{\frac{2}{3}}+3^{\frac{2}{3}}}} }
+\frac{2}{ \frac{\root 3\of 2}{\sqrt{2^{\frac{2}{3}}+3^{\frac{2}{3}}}} }
</mrow><mrow>
&amp; =\sqrt{2^{\frac{2}{3}}+3^{\frac{2}{3}}}
                 \big[3^{\frac{2}{3}}+2^{\frac{2}{3}}\big]
</mrow><mrow>
&amp; ={\big[2^{\frac{2}{3}}+3^{\frac{2}{3}}\big]}^{\frac{3}{2}}
\approx 7.02\text{m}
