<statement><p>
When I was born, I was less than one meter tall. Now, I am more than one meter tall.
What is the conclusion of the Intermediate Value Theorem about my height?
</p></statement>
<hint><p> <m>f</m> is my height.
</p></hint>
<answer><p> At some time between my birth and now, I was exactly one meter tall.
</p></answer>
<solution><p> If we let <m>f</m> be my height, the time of my birth is <m>a</m>, and now is <m>b</m>, then we know that <m>f(a) \leq 1 \leq f(b)</m>. It is reasonable to assume that my height is a continuous function. So by the IVT, there is some value <m>c</m> between <m>a</m> and <m>b</m> where <m>f(c)=1</m>. That is, there is some time (we called it <m>c</m>) between my birth and today when I was exactly one meter tall.
</p>

<p>Notice the IVT does not say precisely what day I was one meter tall; it only guarantees that such a day occurred between my birth and today.

Give an example (by sketch or formula) of a function <m>f(x)</m>, defined on the interval <m>[0,2]</m>, with <m>f(0)=0</m>, <m>f(2)=2</m>, and <m>f(x)</m> never equal to 1. Why does this not contradict the Intermediate Value Theorem?

<statement><p>
Suppose <m>f(t)</m> is continuous at <m>t=5</m>. True or false: <m>t=5</m> is in the domain of <m>f(t)</m>.
</p></statement>
<hint><p>
Compare what is given to you to the definition of continuity.
</p></hint>
<answer><p>
True.
</p></answer>
<solution><p>
True. Since <m>f(t)</m> is continuous at <m>t=5</m>, that means <m>\ds\lim_{t \to 5} f(t)=f(5)</m>. For that to be true, <m>f(5)</m> must exist <mdash/> that is, 5 is in the domain of <m>f(x)</m>.

</p></hint>
<answer><p>
True.

What if the function is discontinuous?
</p></hint>
<answer><p>
In general, false.
</p></answer>
<solution><p>
In general, false. If <m>f(t)</m> is continuous at <m>t=5</m>, then <m>f(5)=17</m>; if <m>f(t)</m> is discontinuous at <m>t=5</m>, then <m>f(5)</m> either does not exist, or is a number other than 17.

Suppose <m>f(x)</m> and <m>g(x)</m> are continuous at <m>x=0</m>, and let <m>h(x)=\dfrac{xf(x)}{g^2(x)+1}</m>. What is <m>\ds\lim_{x \to 0^+} h(x)</m>?

What is <m>h(0)</m>?
</p></hint>
<answer><p>
<m>\ds\lim_{x \to 0^+} h(x)=0</m>
</p></answer>
<solution><p>
Since <m>f(x)</m> and <m>g(x)</m> are continuous at zero, and since <m>g^2(x)+1</m> must be nonzero, then <m>h(x)</m> is continuous at 0 as well. According to the definition of continuity, then <m>\ds\lim_{x \to 0}h(x)</m> exists and is equal to <m>h(0)=\frac{0f(0)}{g^2(0)+1}=0</m>.
</p>

<p>Since the limit <m>\ds\lim_{x \to 0}h(x)</m> exists and is equal to zero, also the one-sided limit
<m>\ds\lim_{x \to 0^+}h(x)</m> exists and is equal to zero.

<exercise purpose="RQS">
<statement><p>Find a constant <m>k</m> so that the function <me>
a(x)=\left\{\begin{array}{ll}
x\sin\left(\frac{1}{x}\right)&amp;\mbox{when } x \neq 0\\
k&amp;\mbox{when }x=0
\end{array}\right.</me>
</p>

<p>is continuous at <m>x=0</m>.
</p></statement>
<hint><p> Use the definition of continuity.
</p></hint>
<answer><p>  <m>k=0</m>
</p></answer>
<solution><p> Using the definition of continuity, we need <m>k=\displaystyle\lim_{x \rightarrow 0} f(x)</m>. Since the limit is blind to what actually happens to <m>f(x)</m> at <m>x=0</m>, this is equivalent to <m>k=\displaystyle\lim_{x \rightarrow 0} x\sin\left(\frac{1}{x}\right)</m>. So if we find the limit, we solve the problem.
</p>

<p>As <m>x</m> gets small, <m>\sin\left(\frac{1}{x}\right)</m> goes a little crazy (see example<nbsp/><xref ref="eg_sinpix"/>),
  so let's get rid of it by using the Squeeze Theorem. We can bound the function above and below, but we should be a little careful about whether we're going from the left or the right. The reason we need to worry about direction is illustrated with the following observation:
</p>

<p>  If <m>a\le b</m> and <m>x \gt 0</m>, then <m>xa\le xb</m>. (For example,
           plug in <m>x=1</m>, <m>a=2</m>, <m>b=3</m>.) But if <m>a\le b</m> and <m>x \lt 0</m>,
           then <m>xa \ge xb</m>. (For example, plug in <m>x=-1</m>, <m>a=2</m>, <m>b=3</m>.)
           So first, let's find
           <m>\lim\limits_{x\rightarrow 0^-}\sin\left(\frac{1}{x}\right)</m>.
           When <m>x \lt 0</m>,
           <md>
<mrow>
              1 \ge &amp;\sin\left(\frac{1}{x}\right) \ge -1
</mrow><mrow>
            \mbox{so: }\qquad
              x({\textcolor{red}{1}}) \le x\,&amp;{\textcolor{red}{\sin\left(\frac{1}{x}\right) }}\le x({\textcolor{red}{-1}})
           </mrow>
</md>
and <m>\displaystyle\lim_{x \rightarrow 0^-} x = \displaystyle\lim_{x \rightarrow 0^-} -x = 0</m>, so by the Squeeze Theorem, also <m>\displaystyle\lim_{x \rightarrow 0^-} x\sin\left(\frac{1}{x}\right)=0</m>.
</p>

<p>Now, let's find <m>\displaystyle\lim_{x \rightarrow 0^+} x\sin\left(\frac{1}{x}\right)</m>. When <m>x \gt 0</m>,
<md>
<mrow>
 -1 \le &amp;\sin\left(\frac{1}{x}\right) \le 1
</mrow><mrow>
\mbox{so: }\qquad
x({\textcolor{red}{-1}}) \leq x&amp;{\textcolor{red}{\sin\left(\frac{1}{x}\right)}}\leq x({\textcolor{red}{1}})
</mrow>
</md>
and <m>\displaystyle\lim_{x \rightarrow 0^+} x = \displaystyle\lim_{x \rightarrow 0^+} -x = 0</m>, so by the Squeeze Theorem, also <m>\displaystyle\lim_{x \rightarrow 0^+} x\sin\left(\frac{1}{x}\right)=0</m>.
</p>

<p>Since the limits from the left and right agree, we conclude <m>\displaystyle\lim_{x \rightarrow 0} x\sin\left(\frac{1}{x}\right)=0</m>, so when <m>k=0</m>, the function is continuous at <m>x=0</m>.

<hint><p> If this is your password, you might want to change it.
</p></hint>
<answer><p> Since <m>f</m> is a polynomial, it is continuous over all real numbers. <m>f(0)=1 \lt 12345</m> and <m>f(12345)=12345^3+12345^2+12345+1 \gt 12345</m> (since all terms are positive). So by the IVT, <m>f(c)=12345</m> for some <m>c</m> between <m>0</m> and <m>12345</m>.

<m>\dfrac{1}{\sqrt{1+\cos(x)}}</m>.
</p></statement>
<hint><p> When is the denominator zero? When is the argument of the square root negative?
</p></hint>
<answer><p>
The function is continuous <em>except</em> at
<m>x=\pm \pi, \pm 3\pi, \pm 5\pi, \cdots </m>.
</p></answer>
<solution><p>
The function <m>1/\sqrt{x}</m> is continuous on <m>(0,+\infty)</m> and the function  <m>\cos(x) +
1</m> is  continuous everywhere.
</p>

<p>So <m>1/\sqrt{\cos(x) + 1 }</m> is continuous except when <m>\cos x=-1</m>. This
happens when <m>x</m> is an odd multiple of <m>\pi</m>. Hence the function is continuous except at

The function is continuous for <m>x\ne c</m> since each of those two branches are polynomials. So, the only question is whether the function is continuous at <m>x=c</m>; for this we need

The function is continuous for <m>x\ne c</m> since each of those two branches are

The general idea is to show that <m>\sin x</m> is somewhere bigger, and somewhere smaller, than <m>x-1</m>. However, since the IVT can only show us that a function is equal to a constant, we need to slightly adjust our language. Showing <m>\sin x = x-1</m> is equivalent to showing <m>\sin x - x + 1 = 0</m>, so let <m>f(x)=\sin x - x +1</m>, and let's show that it has a real root.
</p>

<p>First, we need to note that <m>f(x)</m> is continuous (otherwise we can't use the IVT). Now, we need to find a value of <m>x</m> for which it is positive, and for which it's negative. By checking a few values, we find <m>f(0)</m> is positive, and <m>f(100)</m> is negative.  So, by the IVT, there exists a value of <m>x</m> (between <m>0</m> and <m>100</m>) for which <m>f(x)=0</m>. Therefore, there exists a value of <m>x</m> for which <m>\sin x = x-1</m>.

<statement><p>Use the intermediate value theorem to find an interval of length one containing a root of <m>f(x)=x^7-15x^6+9x^2-18x+15</m>.

<hint><p> We want <m>f(x)</m> to be 0; 0 is between a positive number and a negative number. Try evaluating <m>f(x)</m> for some integer values of <m>x</m>.
</p></hint>
<answer><p> <m>[0,1]</m> is the easiest answer to find. Also acceptable are <m>[-2,-1]</m> and <m>[14,15]</m>.
</p></answer>
<solution><p> <m>f(x)</m> is a polynomial, so it's continuous everywhere. If we can find values <m>a</m> and <m>b</m> so that <m>f(a) \gt 0</m> and <m>f(b) \lt 0</m>, then by the IVT, there will exist some <m>c</m> in <m>(a,b)</m> where <m>f(c)=0</m>; that is, there is a root in the interval <m>[a,b]</m>. Let's start plugging in easy values of <m>x</m>.
</p>

<p><m>f(0)=15</m>, and <m>f(1)=1-15+9-18+15=-8</m>. Since 0 is between <m>f(0)</m> and <m>f(1)</m>, and since <m>f</m> is continuous, by IVT there must be some <m>x</m> in <m>[0,1]</m> for which <m>f(x)=0</m>: that is, there is some root in <m>[0,1]</m>.
</p>

<p>That was the easiest interval to find. If you keep playing around, you find two more. <m>f(-1)=26</m> (positive) and <m>f(-2)=-1001</m> (negative), so there is a root in <m>[-2,-1]</m>.
</p>

<p>The arithmetic is nasty, but there is also a root in <m>[14,15]</m>.
</p>

<p>This is an important trick. For high-degree polynomials, it is often impossible to get the exact values of the roots. Using the IVT, we can at least give a range where a root must be.

</p></hint>
<answer><p> 1.91
</p></answer>
<solution><p>
Let <m>f(x)=x^3</m>. Since <m>f</m> is a polynomial, it is continuous everywhere. If <m>f(a) \lt 7 \lt f(b)</m>, then <m>\sqrt[3]{7}</m> is somewhere between <m>a</m> and <m>b</m>. If we can find <m>a</m> and <m>b</m> that satisfy these inequalities, and are very close together, that will give us a good approximation for <m>\sqrt[3]{7}</m>.
</p>

<p><ul>
<li> Let's start with integers. <m>1^3 \lt 7 \lt 2^3</m>, so <m>\sqrt[3]{7}</m> is in the interval <m>(1,2)</m>.
</li>
<li> Let's narrow this down, say by testing <m>f(1.5)</m>. <m>(1.5)^3 = 3.375 \lt 7</m>, so <m>\sqrt[3]{7}</m> is in the interval <m>(1.5,2)</m>.
</li>
<li>  Let's narrow further, say by testing <m>f(1.75)</m>. <m>(1.75)^3\approx 5.34 \lt 7</m>, so <m>\sqrt[3]{7}</m> is in the interval <m>(1.75,2)</m>.
</li>
<li> Testing various points, we find <m>f(1.9) \lt 7 \lt f(2)</m>, so <m>\sqrt[3]{7}</m> is between <m>1.9</m> and <m>2</m>.
</li>
<li> By testing more, we find
<m>f(1.91) \lt 7 \lt f(1.92)</m>, so <m>\sqrt[3]{7}</m> is in <m>(1.91,1.92)</m>.
</li>
<li> In order to get an approximation for <m>\sqrt[3]{7}</m> that is rounded to two decimal places, we have to know whether <m>\sqrt[3]{7}</m> is greater or less than <m>1.915</m>; indeed <m>f(1.915) \approx 7.02 \gt 7</m>, so
<m>\sqrt[3]{7} \lt 1.915</m>; then rounded to two decimal places, <m>\sqrt[3]{7}\approx 1.91</m>.
</li>
</ul>
If this seems like the obvious way to approximate <m>\sqrt[3]{7}</m>, that's good. The IVT is a formal statement of a very intuitive principle.
