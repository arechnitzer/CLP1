<exercise xml:id="s3_6_3converse">
<statement><p>
Suppose <m>f(x)</m> is a function whose second derivative exists and is continuous for all real numbers.
</p>

<p>True or false: if <m>f''(3)=0</m>, then <m>x=3</m> is an inflection point of <m>f(x)</m>.
</p>

<p>Remark: compare to Question<nbsp/><xref ref="s3_6_3IVT"/>
</p></statement>
<hint><p>
Consider <m>f(x)=(x-3)^4</m>.
</p></hint>
<answer><p>
In general, false.
</p></answer>
<solution><p>
An inflection point is where the concavity of a function changes. It is possible that <m>x=3</m> is an inflection point, but it is also possible that is not. So, the statement is false, in general.
</p>

<p>For example, let <m>f(x)=(x-3)^4</m>. Since <m>f(x)</m> is a polynomial, all its derivatives exist and are continuous. <m>f''(x)=12(x-3)^2</m>, so <m>f''(3)=0</m>. However, since <m>f''(x)</m> is something squared, it is never negative, so <m>f(x)</m> is never concave down. Since <m>f(x)</m> is never concave down, it never changes concavity, so it has no inflection points.
</p>

<p>Remark: finding inflection points is somewhat reminiscent of finding local extrema. To find local extrema, we first find all critical and singular points, since local extrema can only occur there or at endpoints. Then, we have to figure out which critical and singular points are actually local extrema. Similarly, if you want to find inflection points, start by finding where <m>f''(x)</m> is zero or non-existant, because inflection points can only occur there (see Question<nbsp/><xref ref="s3_6_3IVT"/>). Then, you still have to check whether those points are actually inflection points.

<statement><p>
Find all inflection points for the graph of <m>f(x)=3x^5-5x^4+13x</m>.
</p></statement>
<answer><p>
<m>x=1,\ y=11</m>
</p></answer>
<solution><p>
Inflection points occur where <m>f''(x)</m> changes sign. Since <m>f(x)</m> is a polynomial, its first and second derivatives exist everywhere, and are themselves polynomials. In particular,
<md>
<mrow>f(x)&amp;=3x^5-5x^4+13x
</mrow><mrow>
f'(x)&amp;=15x^4-20x^3+13
</mrow><mrow>
f''(x)&amp;=60x^3-60x^2=60x^2(x-1)
</mrow>
</md>
The second derivative is negative for <m>x \lt 1</m> and positive for <m>x \gt 1</m>. Thus
the concavity changes between concave up and concave down at
{<m>x=1,\ y=11</m>}.
</p>

<p>This is the only inflection point. It is true that <m>f''(0)=0</m>, but for values of <m>x</m> both a little larger than and a little smaller than 0, <m>f''(x) \lt 0</m>, so the concavity does not change at <m>x=0</m>.

<exercise xml:id="s3_6_3proof1" purpose="RQS"><title><fromexam>1997A</fromexam></title>
<statement><p>
Let
<me>
f(x)=\frac{x^5}{20}+\frac{5x^3}{6}-10x^2+500x+1000</me>
</p>

<p>Show that <m>f(x)</m> has exactly one inflection point.
</p></statement>
<hint><p>
You must show it has at least one inflection point (try the Intermediate Value Theorem), and at most one inflection point (consider whether the second derivative is increasing or decreasing).
</p></hint>
<answer><p>
Let <me>
g(x)=f''(x)=x^3+5x-20.</me>
 Then <m>g'(x)=3x^2+5</m>, which is always positive. That means <m>g(x)</m> is strictly increasing for all <m>x</m>. So, <m>g(x)</m> can change signs once, from negative to positive, but it can never change back to negative. An inflection point of <m>f(x)</m> occurs when <m>g(x)</m> changes signs. So, <m>f(x)</m> has <em>at most one</em> inflection point.
</p>

<p>Since <m>g(x)</m> is continuous, we can apply the Intermediate Value Theorem to it. Notice
<m>g(3) \gt 0</m> while <m>g(0) \lt 0</m>. By the IVT, <m>g(x)=0</m> for at least one <m>x \in (0,3)</m>. Since <m>g(x)</m> is strictly increasing, at the point where <m>g(x)=0</m>, <m>g(x)</m> changes from negative to positive. So, the concavity of <m>f(x)</m> changes. Therefore, <m>f(x)</m> has <em>at least one</em> inflection point.
</p>

<p>Now that we've shown that <m>f(x)</m> has at most one inflection point, and at least one inflection point, we conclude it has exactly one inflection point.</p></answer>
<solution><p>
In order to show that <m>f(x)</m> has <em>exactly one</em> inflection point, we will show that is has <em>at least one</em>, and <em>no more than one</em>.
</p>

<p>Let <me>
g(x)=f''(x)=x^3+5x-20.</me>
 Then <m>g'(x)=3x^2+5</m>, which is always positive. That means <m>g(x)</m> is strictly increasing for all <m>x</m>. So, <m>g(x)</m> can change signs once, from negative to positive, but it can never change back to negative. An inflection point of <m>f(x)</m> occurs when <m>g(x)</m> changes signs. So, <m>f(x)</m> has at most one inflection point. (At this point, we don't know that <m>f(x)</m> has any inflection points: maybe <m>g(x)</m> is always positive.)
</p>

<p>Since <m>g(x)</m> is continuous, we can apply the Intermediate Value Theorem to it. Notice
<m>g(3) \gt 0</m> while <m>g(0) \lt 0</m>. By the IVT, <m>g(x)=0</m> for at least one <m>x \in (0,3)</m>. Since <m>g(x)</m> is strictly increasing, at the point where <m>g(x)=0</m>, <m>g(x)</m> changes from negative to positive. So, the concavity of <m>f(x)</m> changes. Therefore, <m>f(x)</m> has at least one inflection point.
</p>

<p>Now that we've shown that <m>f(x)</m> has at most one inflection point, and at least one inflection point, we conclude it has exactly one inflection point.

Let
<me>
g(x)=f'(x)</me>
</p>

<p>Then <m>f''(x)</m> is the derivative of <m>g(x)</m>. Since <m>f''(x) \gt 0</m> for all <m>x</m>, <m>g(x)=f'(x)</m> is strictly increasing
for all <m>x</m>.
In other words, if <m>y \gt x</m> then <m>g(y) \gt g(x)</m>.
</p>

<p>Suppose <m>g(x)=0</m>. Then for every <m>y</m> that is larger than <m>x</m>, <m>g(y) \gt g(x)</m>, so <m>g(y) \neq 0</m>. Similarly, for every <m>y</m> that is smaller than <m>x</m>, <m>g(y) \lt g(x)</m>, so <m>g(y) \neq 0</m>. Therefore, <m>g(x)</m> can only be zero for at most one value of <m>x</m>. Since <m>g(x)=f'(x)</m>, that means <m>f(x)</m> can have at most one critical point.
</p>

<p>Suppose <m>f'(c)=0</m>. Since

<p>Since <m>f''(a) \lt 0</m> and <m>f''(b) \gt 0</m>, and since <m>f''(x)</m> is continuous, the Intermediate Value Theorem tells us that there exists some <m>x</m> strictly between <m>a</m> and <m>b</m> with <m>f''(x)=0</m>. So, we know <m>f''(x)=0</m> somewhere between <m>a</m> and <m>b</m>. The question is, where exactly could that be?

<p><ul>
<li> <m>f''(x) \lt 0</m> (and hence <m>f''(x) \neq 0</m>) for all <m>x</m> between <m>a</m> and 3

<li> <m>f''(x) \gt 0</m> (and hence <m>f''(x) \neq 0</m>)  for all <m>x</m> between <m>b</m> and 3
</li>
<li> So, any number between <m>a</m> and <m>b</m> that is not 3 has <m>f''(x)\neq 0</m>.
</li>
</ul>
So, <m>x=3</m> is the only possible place between <m>a</m> and <m>b</m> where <m>f''(x)</m> could be zero. Therefore, <m>f''(3)=0</m>.
</p></answer>
<solution><p>
If <m>x=3</m> is an inflection point, then the concavity of <m>f(x)</m> changes at <m>x=3</m>. That is, there is some interval strictly containing 3, with endpoints <m>a</m> and <m>b</m>, such that
<ul>
<li> <textblue><m>f''(a) \lt 0</m> and <m>f''(x) \lt 0</m> for every <m>x</m> between <m>a</m> and 3,</textblue> and
</li>
<li> <textred><m>f''(b) \gt 0</m> and <m>f''(x) \gt 0</m> for every <m>x</m> between <m>b</m> and 3.</textred>
</li>
</ul>
Remark: we are leaving unknown whether <m>a \lt 3 \lt b</m> or <m>b \lt 3 \lt a</m>. Since we don't know whether <m>f(x)</m> changes from concave up to concave down, or from concave down to concave up, by remaining vague we cover both cases.</p>
