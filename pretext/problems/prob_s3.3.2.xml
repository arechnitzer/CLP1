<statement><p>
Which of the following functions <m>T(t)</m> satisfy the differential equation
<m>\ds\diff{T}{t}=5\left[T-20\right]</m>?

</statement>
<hint><p>
You can refer to Corollary<nbsp/><xref ref="cor_coolingDEsoln"/>,
but you can also just differentiate the various proposed functions and see whether, in fact, <m>\ds\diff{T}{t}</m> is the same as <m>5[T-20]</m>.
</p></hint>
<answer><p> (a), (c), (d)
</p></answer>
<solution><p>
Using Corollary<nbsp/><xref ref="cor_coolingDEsoln"/> (with <m>A=20</m> and <m>K=5</m>),  solutions to the differential equation all have the form
<me>
T(t)=[T(0)-20]e^{5t}+20</me>
 for some constant <m>T(0)</m>. This fits (a) (with <m>T(0)=20</m>), (c) (with <m>T(0)=21)</m>, and (d) (with <m>T(0)=40</m>), but not (b) (since the constant has the wrong sign).
</p>

<p>Instead of using the corollary, we can also just check each function for ourselves.
<ol  label="a">
<li> <m>\ds\diff{T}{t}=0=5\cdot0=5[T(t)-20]</m>, so (a) gives a solution to the differential equation.
</li>
<li> <m>\ds\diff{T}{t}=5[20e^{5t}]=5[T+20] \neq 5[T-20]</m>, so (b) does not give a solution to the differential equation.
</li>
<li> <m>\ds\diff{T}{t}=5[e^{5t}]=5[T-20]</m>, so (c) gives a solution to the differential equation.
</li>
<li> <m>\ds\diff{T}{t}=5[20e^{5t}]=5[T-20]</m>,
so (d) gives a solution to the differential equation.

<statement><p>
At time <m>t=0</m>, an object is placed in a room, of temperature <m>A</m>. After <m>t</m> seconds, Newton's Law of Cooling gives the temperature of the object is as
<me>
T(t)=35e^{Kt}-10</me>
</p>

<p>What is the temperature of the room? Is the room warmer or colder than the object?
</p></statement>
<hint><p>
From Newton's Law of Cooling and Corollary<nbsp/><xref ref="cor_coolingDEsoln"/>, the temperature of the object will be
<me>
T(t)=[T(0)-A]e^{Kt}+A</me>
</p>

<p>where <m>A</m> is the ambient temperature, <m>T(0)</m> is the initial temperature of the copper, and <m>K</m> is some constant.
</p></hint>
<answer><p>
The temperature of the room is -10 degrees, and the room is colder than the object.
</p></answer>
<solution><p>
From Newton's Law of Cooling and Corollary<nbsp/><xref ref="cor_coolingDEsoln"/>, the temperature of the object will be
<me>
T(t)=[T(0)-A]e^{Kt}+A</me>
</p>

<p>where <m>A</m> is the ambient temperature (the temperature of the room), <m>T(0)</m> is the initial temperature of the copper, and <m>K</m> is some constant. So, the ambient temperature--the temperature of the room-- is <m>-10</m> degrees. Since the coefficient of the exponential part of the function is positive, the temperature of the object is higher than the temperature of the room.
</p></solution>
</exercise>

<exercise xml:id="s3_3_2Knegative" purpose="RQS">
<statement><p>
A warm object is placed in a cold room. The temperature of the object, over time, approaches the temperature of the room it is in. The temperature of the object at time <m>t</m> is given by
<me>
T(t)=[T(0)-A]e^{Kt}+A.</me>
</p>

<p>Can <m>K</m> be a positive number? Can <m>K</m> be a negative number? Can <m>K</m> be zero?
</p></statement>
<hint><p>
What is <m>\ds\lim_{t \to \infty}e^{Kt}</m> when <m>K</m> is positive, negative, or zero?
</p></hint>
<answer><p> <m>K</m> is a negative number. It cannot be positive or zero.
</p></answer>
<solution><p>
As <m>t</m> grows very large, <m>T(t)</m> approaches <m>A</m>. That is:
<md>
<mrow>
\ds\lim_{t \to \infty}T(t)&amp;=A
</mrow><mrow>
\lim_{t \to \infty}[T(0)-A]e^{Kt}+A&amp;=A
</mrow><mrow>
\lim_{t \to \infty}[T(0)-A]e^{Kt}&amp;=0
</mrow>
<intertext>Since the object is warmer than the room, <m>T(0)-A</m> is a nonzero constant. So,</intertext><mrow>
\lim_{t \to \infty}e^{Kt}&amp;=0
</mrow>
</md>
This tells us that <m>K</m> is a negative number. So, <m>K</m> must be negative--not zero, and not positive.
</p>

<p>Remark: in our work, we used the fact that the object and the room have different temperatures (but it didn't matter which one was hotter). If not, then <m>T(0)=A</m>, and <m>T(t)=A</m>: that is, the temperature of the object is constant. In this case, our usual form for the temperature of the object looks like this:
<me>
T(t)=0e^{Kt}+A</me>
</p>

<p>Keeping the exponential piece in there is overkill: the temperature isn't changing, the function is simply constant. If the object and the room have the same temperature, <m>K</m> could be any real number since we're multiplying <m>e^{Kt}</m> by zero.
</p>

<p>Remark: contrast this to Question<nbsp/><xref ref="s3_3_2Knegative2"/>.

<exercise>
<statement><p>
Suppose an object obeys Newton's Law of Cooling, and its temperature is given by
<me>
T(t)=[T(0)-A]e^{kt}+A</me>
</p>

<p>for some constant <m>k</m>. At what time is <m>T(t)=A</m>?
</p></statement>
<hint><p>
Solve <m>A=[T(0)-A]e^{kt}</m> for <m>t</m>.
</p></hint>
<answer><p>
If the object has a different initial temperature than its surroundings, then <m>T(t)</m> is <em>never</em> equal to <m>A</m>. (But as time goes on, it gets closer and closer.)
</p>
<p>
If the object starts out with the same temperature as its surrounding, then <m>T(t)=A</m> for all values of <m>t</m>.
</p></answer>
<solution><p>
We want to know when
<md>
<mrow>
[T(0)-A]e^{kt}+A&amp;=A
</mrow>
<intertext>That is, when</intertext><mrow>
[T(0)-A]e^{kt}&amp;=0
</mrow>
<intertext>Since <m>e^{kt} \gt 0</m> for all values of <m>k</m> and <m>t</m>, this happens exactly when</intertext><mrow>
T(0)-A=0
</mrow>
</md>
So: if the initial temperature of the object is not the same as the ambient temperature, then according to this model, it never will be! (However, as <m>t</m> gets larger and larger, <m>T(t)</m> gets closer and closer to <m>A</m>--it just never exactly reaches there.)
</p>

<p>If the initial temperature of the object starts out the same as the ambient temperature, then <m>T(t)=A</m> for all values of <m>t</m>.

<statement><p>
Isaac Newton drinks his coffee with cream. To be exact, 9 parts coffee
to 1 part cream. His landlady pours him a cup of coffee at
<m>95^\circ</m> C into which Newton stirs cream taken from the icebox at <m>5^\circ</m> C.
When he drinks the mixture ten minutes later, he notes that it has cooled
to <m>54^\circ</m> C.
 Newton wonders if his coffee would be hotter (and by how much) if he
waited until just before drinking it to add the cream. Analyze this question,
assuming that:
<ol label="i">
<li> The temperature of the dining room is constant at <m>22^\circ</m> C.
</li>
<li> When a volume <m>V_1</m> of liquid at temperature <m>T_1</m> is mixed
with a volume <m>V_2</m> at temperature <m>T_2</m>, the temperature of the mixture
is <m>\dfrac{V_1T_1+V_2T_2}{V_1+V_2}</m>.
</li>
<li> Newton's Law of Cooling: The temperature of an object
cools at a rate proportional to the difference in temperature between the
object and its surroundings.
</li>
<li> The constant of proportionality is the same for the cup
of coffee with cream as for the cup of pure coffee.
</li>
</ol>
</p></statement>
<answer><p>
If Newton adds his cream just before drinking, the coffee
ends up {cooler by <m>0.85^\circ</m> C}.
</p></answer>
<solution><p>
<ul>
<li> First scenario: At time <m>0</m>, Newton mixes 9 parts coffee at temperature
<m>95^\circ</m> C with 1 part cream at temperature <m>5^\circ</m> C. The resulting
mixture has temperature
<me>
\frac{9\times 95+1\times 5}{9+1}=86^\circ
</me>
The mixture cools according to Newton's Law of Cooling, with initial temperature 86<m>^\circ</m> and ambient temperature 22<m>^\circ</m>:

 e^{-10 k}&amp;=\frac{54-22}{64}=\frac{1}{2}
</mrow>
</md>
We could compute <m>k</m> from this, but we don't need it.
</li>
<li> Second scenario: At time <m>0</m>, Newton gets hot coffee at temperature
<m>95^\circ</m> C. It cools according to Newton's Law of Cooling
<md>
<mrow>
T(t)=[T(0)-22]e^{-kt}+22
</mrow>
</md>
In this second scenario, <m>T(0)=95</m>, so
<me>
T(t)=[95-22]e^{-kt}+22=73e^{-kt}+22
</me>
The value of <m>k</m> is the same as in the first scenario, so after 10 minutes
<me>
T(10)=22+73e^{-10k}=22+73\frac{1}{2}=58.5
</me>
This cooled coffee is mixed with cold cream to yield a mixture of temperature
<me>
\frac{9\times 58.5+1\times 5}{9+1}=\color{red}{53.15}
</me>
</li>
</ul>
Under the second (add cream just before drinking) scenario, the coffee
ends up {cooler by <m>0.85^\circ</m> C}<m>\,</m>.

Suppose an object is changing temperature according to Newton's Law of Cooling, and its temperature at time <m>t</m> is given by

<p>Is <m>k</m> positive or negative?

<answer><p>
positive
</p></answer>
<solution><p>
As time goes on, temperatures that follow Newton's Law of Cooling get closer and closer to the ambient temperature. So, <m>\ds\lim_{t \to \infty} T(t)</m> exists. In particular,
<m>\ds\lim_{t \to \infty} 0.8^{kt}</m> exists.
<ul>
<li> If <m>k \lt 0</m>, then <m>\ds\lim_{t \to \infty}0.8^{kt} = \infty</m>, since <m>0.8 \lt 1</m>. So, <m>k \geq 0</m>.
</li>
<li> If <m>k=0</m>, then <m>T(t)=16</m> for all values of <m>t</m>. But, in the statement of the question, the object is changing temperature. So, <m>k \gt 0</m>.
</li>
</ul>
Therefore, <m>k</m> is positive.
</p>

<p>Remark: contrast this to Question<nbsp/><xref ref="s3_3_2Knegative"/>. The reason we get a different answer is that our base in this question (0.8) is less than one, while the base in
Question<nbsp/><xref ref="s3_3_2Knegative"/> (<m>e</m>) is greater than one.

<p>Although the given equation <m>T(t)</m> does not exactly look like the Newton's Law equations we're used to, it is equivalent.
