<answer><p> If <m>Q</m> is to the left of the <m>y</m> axis, the secant line has positive slope;

<solution><p> If <m>Q</m> is to the left of the <m>y</m> axis, the line through <m>Q</m> and <m>P</m> is increasing, so the secant line has positive slope.
If <m>Q</m> is to the right of the <m>y</m> axis, the line through <m>Q</m> and <m>P</m> is decreasing, so the secant line has negative slope.

<p>
<xref ref="s2_1p2_2"/> the tangent line has the larger slope
</p></answer>
<solution><p><xref ref="s2_1p2_1"/> By drawing a few pictures, it's easy to see that sliding <m>Q</m> closer to <m>P</m>, the slope of the secant line increases.
</p>

<p><xref ref="s2_1p2_2"/> Since the slope of the secant line increases the closer <m>Q</m> gets to <m>P</m>, that means the tangent line (which is the limit as <m>Q</m> approaches <m>P</m>) has a larger slope than the secant line between <m>Q</m> and <m>P</m> (using the location where <m>Q</m> is right now).

<p>Alternately, by simply sketching the tangent line at <m>P</m>, we can see that has a steeper slope than the secant line between <m>P</m> and <m>Q</m>.

<hint><p> Your calculations for slope of the secant lines will all have the same denominators; to save yourself some time, you can focus on the numerators.
</p></hint>
<answer><p> <m> \{(a), (c), (e)\}, \{(b),(f)\}, \{(d)\}</m>
</p></answer>
<solution><p> The slope of the secant line will be <m>\dfrac{f(2)-f(-2)}{2-(-2)} = \dfrac{f(2)-f(-2)}{4}</m>, in every part. So, if two lines have the same slope, that means their differences <m>f(2)-f(-2)</m> will be the same.
</p>

<p>The graphs in (a),(c), and (e) all have <m>f(2)-f(-2)=1</m>, so they all have the same secant line slope. The graphs in (b) and (f) both have <m>f(2)-f(-2)=-1</m>, so they both have the same secant line slope. The graph in (d) has <m>f(2)-f(-2)=0</m>, and it is the only graph with this property, so it does not share its secant line slope with any of the other graphs.

Give your best approximation of the slope of the tangent line to
the graph below at the point <m>x=5</m>.

</statement>

<hint><p> You can do this by calculating several secant lines. You can also do this by getting out a ruler and trying to draw the tangent line very carefully.
</p></hint>
<answer><p> Something like <m>1.5</m>. A reasonable answer would be between 1 and 2.
</p></answer>
<solution><p> A good approximation from the graph is <m>f(5)=0.5</m>. We want to find a secant line whose endpoints are both very close to <m>x=5</m>, but that also give us clear <m>y</m>-values. It looks like <m>f(5.25) \approx 1</m>, and <m>f(4.75)\approx \frac{1}{8}</m>. The secant line from <m>x=5</m> to <m>x=5.25</m> has approximate slope <m>\dfrac{f(5.25)-f(5)}{5.25-5}\approx \dfrac{1-.5}{.25}=2</m>. The secant line from <m>x=5</m> to <m>x=4.75</m> has approximate slope <m>\dfrac{0.5-\frac{1}{8}}{5-4.75}=\dfrac{3}{2}</m>.
</p>

<p>The graph increases more and more quickly (gets steeper and steeper), so it makes sense that the secant line to the left of <m>x=5</m> has a smaller slope than the secant line to the right of <m>x=5</m>.  Also, if you're taking secant lines that have endpoints farther out from <m>x=5</m>, you'll notice that the slopes of the secant lines change quite dramatically. You have to be very, very close to <m>x=5</m> to get any kind of accuracy.
</p>

<p>If we split the difference, we might approximate the slope of the secant line to be the average of <m>\frac{3}{2}</m> and <m>2</m>, which is <m>\frac{7}{4}</m>.
</p>

<p>Another way to try to figure out the tangent line is by carefully drawing it in with a ruler. This is shown here in blue:

<p>It's much easier to take the slope of a line than a curve, and this one looks like it has slope about 1.5. However, we drew this with a computer: by hand it's much harder to draw an accurate tangent line. (That's why we need calculus!)
</p>

<p>The actual slope of the tangent line to the function at <m>x=5</m> is about <m>1.484</m>. This is extremely hard to figure out just from the graph--by hand, a guess between <m>1.25</m> and <m>1.75</m> would be very accurate.
