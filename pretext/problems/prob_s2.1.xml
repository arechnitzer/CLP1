<answer><p> If <m>Q</m> is to the left of the <m>y</m> axis, the secant line has positive slope;

</p></answer>
<solution><p> If <m>Q</m> is to the left of the <m>y</m> axis, the line through <m>Q</m> and <m>P</m> is increasing, so the secant line has positive slope.
If <m>Q</m> is to the right of the <m>y</m> axis, the line through <m>Q</m> and <m>P</m> is decreasing, so the secant line has negative slope.

<answer><p><xref ref="s2_1p2_1"/> closer
</p>
<p>
<xref ref="s2_1p2_2"/> the tangent line has the larger slope
</p></answer>
<solution><p><xref ref="s2_1p2_1"/> By drawing a few pictures, it's easy to see that sliding <m>Q</m> closer to <m>P</m>, the slope of the secant line increases.
</p>

<p><xref ref="s2_1p2_2"/> Since the slope of the secant line increases the closer <m>Q</m> gets to <m>P</m>, that means the tangent line (which is the limit as <m>Q</m> approaches <m>P</m>) has a larger slope than the secant line between <m>Q</m> and <m>P</m> (using the location where <m>Q</m> is right now).
</p>

<p>Alternately, by simply sketching the tangent line at <m>P</m>, we can see that has a steeper slope than the secant line between <m>P</m> and <m>Q</m>.

<hint><p> Your calculations for slope of the secant lines will all have the same denominators; to save yourself some time, you can focus on the numerators.
</p></hint>
<answer><p> <m> \{(a), (c), (e)\}, \{(b),(f)\}, \{(d)\}</m>
</p></answer>
<solution><p> The slope of the secant line will be <m>\dfrac{f(2)-f(-2)}{2-(-2)} = \dfrac{f(2)-f(-2)}{4}</m>, in every part. So, if two lines have the same slope, that means their differences <m>f(2)-f(-2)</m> will be the same.
</p>

<p>The graphs in (a),(c), and (e) all have <m>f(2)-f(-2)=1</m>, so they all have the same secant line slope. The graphs in (b) and (f) both have <m>f(2)-f(-2)=-1</m>, so they both have the same secant line slope. The graph in (d) has <m>f(2)-f(-2)=0</m>, and it is the only graph with this property, so it does not share its secant line slope with any of the other graphs.

<statement><p>
Give your best approximation of the slope of the tangent line to
the graph below at the point <m>x=5</m>.

</statement>

<hint><p> You can do this by calculating several secant lines. You can also do this by getting out a ruler and trying to draw the tangent line very carefully.
</p></hint>
<answer><p> Something like <m>1.5</m>. A reasonable answer would be between 1 and 2.
</p></answer>
<solution><p> A good approximation from the graph is <m>f(5)=0.5</m>. We want to find a secant line whose endpoints are both very close to <m>x=5</m>, but that also give us clear <m>y</m>-values. It looks like <m>f(5.25) \approx 1</m>, and <m>f(4.75)\approx \frac{1}{8}</m>. The secant line from <m>x=5</m> to <m>x=5.25</m> has approximate slope <m>\dfrac{f(5.25)-f(5)}{5.25-5}\approx \dfrac{1-.5}{.25}=2</m>. The secant line from <m>x=5</m> to <m>x=4.75</m> has approximate slope <m>\dfrac{0.5-\frac{1}{8}}{5-4.75}=\dfrac{3}{2}</m>.
</p>

<p>The graph increases more and more quickly (gets steeper and steeper), so it makes sense that the secant line to the left of <m>x=5</m> has a smaller slope than the secant line to the right of <m>x=5</m>.  Also, if you're taking secant lines that have endpoints farther out from <m>x=5</m>, you'll notice that the slopes of the secant lines change quite dramatically. You have to be very, very close to <m>x=5</m> to get any kind of accuracy.
</p>

<p>If we split the difference, we might approximate the slope of the secant line to be the average of <m>\frac{3}{2}</m> and <m>2</m>, which is <m>\frac{7}{4}</m>.
</p>

<p>Another way to try to figure out the tangent line is by carefully drawing it in with a ruler. This is shown here in blue:

<p>It's much easier to take the slope of a line than a curve, and this one looks like it has slope about 1.5. However, we drew this with a computer: by hand it's much harder to draw an accurate tangent line. (That's why we need calculus!)
</p>

<p>The actual slope of the tangent line to the function at <m>x=5</m> is about <m>1.484</m>. This is extremely hard to figure out just from the graph--by hand, a guess between <m>1.25</m> and <m>1.75</m> would be very accurate.
