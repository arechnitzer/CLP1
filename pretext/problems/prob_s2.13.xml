<exercise purpose="RQS">
<statement><p>
Suppose a particular caribou has a top speed of 70 kph, and in one year it migrates 5000 km. What do you know about the amount of time the caribou spent travelling during its migration?
</p></statement>
<hint><p>
How long would it take the caribou to travel 5000 km, travelling at its top speed?
</p></hint>
<answer><p>
The caribou spent <em>at least</em> about 71 and a half hours travelling during its migration (probably much more) in one year.
</p></answer>
<solution><p>
We know the top speed of the caribou, so we can use this to give the <em>minimum</em> possible number of hours the caribou spent travelling during its migration. If the caribou travels at 70kph, it will take <m>(5000 \mathrm{km})\left(\dfrac{1 \mathrm{hr}}{70 \mathrm{km}}\right) \approx 71.4 \mathrm{hrs}</m> to travel 5000 kilometres. Probably the caribou wasn't sprinting the whole time, so probably it took it longer than that, but we can only say for sure that the caribou spent <em>at least</em> about 71.4 hours migrating.

<exercise purpose="RQS">
<statement><p>
Suppose a migrating sandhill crane flew 240 kilometres in one day. What does the mean value theorem tell you about its speed during that day?
</p></statement>
<hint><p>
Let <m>f(x)</m> be the position of the crane, where <m>x</m> is the hour of the day.
</p></hint>
<answer><p>
At some point during the day, the crane was travelling at exactly 10 kph.
</p></answer>
<solution><p>
If <m>f(x)</m> is the position of the crane at time <m>x</m>, measured in hours, then (if we let <m>x=0</m> be the beginning of the day) we know that <m>f(24)-f(0)=240</m>. Since <m>f(x)</m> is the position of the bird, <m>f(x)</m> is continuous and differentiable. So, the MVT says there is a <m>c</m> in <m>(0,24)</m> such that <m>f'(x)=\dfrac{f(24)-f(0)}{24-0}=\dfrac{240}{24}=10</m>. That is, at some point <m>c</m> during the day, the speed of the crane was exactly 10 kph.

The MVT guarantees there is some point <m>c</m> strictly between <m>a</m> and <m>b</m> where the tangent line to <m>f(x)</m> at <m>x=c</m> has the same slope as the secant line of <m>f(x)</m> from <m>x=a</m> to <m>x=b</m>. So, let's start by drawing in the secant line.</p>

<exercise>
<statement><p>
Give a function <m>f(x)</m> with the properties that:
<ul>
<li> <m>f(x)</m> is differentiable on the open interval <m>0 \lt x \lt 10</m>
</li>
<li> <m>f(0)=0</m>, <m>f(10)=10</m>
</li>
</ul>
but for all <m>c \in (0,10)</m>, <m>f'(c)=0</m>.
</p></statement>
<hint><p>
How does this question differ from the statement of the mean value theorem?
</p></hint>
<answer><p>
One possible answer: <m>f(x) = \left\{\begin{array}{lr}
0&amp;x \neq 10\\
10&amp;x=10
\end{array}\right.</m>
</p>

<p>Another answer:
<m>f(x) = \left\{\begin{array}{lr}
10&amp;x \neq 0\\
0&amp;x=0
\end{array}\right.</m>
</p>

<p>Yet another answer:
<m>f(x) = \left\{\begin{array}{ll}
5&amp;x \neq 0, 10\\
10&amp;x= 10\\
0&amp;x=0
\end{array}\right.</m>
</p></answer>
<solution><p>
Since <m>f(x)</m> is differentiable for all <m>x \in (0,10)</m>, then <m>f(x)</m> is also continuous for all <m>x \in (0,10)</m>. If <m>f(x)</m> were continuous on the closed interval <m>[0,10]</m>, then the MVT would guarantee <m>f'(x)=\dfrac{f(10)-f(0)}{10-0}=1</m> for some <m>c \in (0,10)</m>; however, this is not the case. So, it must be that <m>f(x)</m> is continuous for all <m>x \in (0,10)</m>, but not for all <m>x \in [0,10]</m>.
</p>

<p>Since <m>f'(c)=0</m> for <m>c \in (0,10)</m>, that means <m>f</m> is constant on that interval. So, <m>f(x)</m> is a function like this:</p>

</sidebyside>
<p>where the height of the constant function can be anything.
</p>

<p>So, one possible answer is <m>f(x) = \left\{\begin{array}{lr}
0&amp;x \neq 10\\
10&amp;x=10
\end{array}\right.</m>.

<statement><p>
Suppose you want to show that a point exists where the function <m>f(x)=\sqrt{|x|}</m> has a tangent line with slope <m>\frac{1}{13}</m>. Find the mistake(s) in the following work, and give a correct proof.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
The function <m>f(x)</m> is continuous and differentiable over all real numbers, so the mean value theorem applies. <m>f(-4)=2</m> and <m>f(9)=3</m>, so by the mean value theorem, there exists some <m>c \in (-4,9)</m> such that
<m>f'(x) = \dfrac{3-2}{9-(-4)}=\dfrac{1}{13}</m>.
</p></blockquote>
</statement>
<hint><p>
Where is <m>f(x)</m> differentiable?
</p></hint>
<answer><p>
The function <m>f(x)</m> is continuous over all real numbers, but it is only differentiable when <m>x \neq 0</m>. So, if we want to apply the MVT, our interval must consist of only positive numbers or only negative numbers: the interval <m>(-4,13)</m> is not valid.
</p>

<p>It is possible to use the mean value theorem to prove what we want: if <m>a=1</m> and <m>b=144</m>, then <m>f(x)</m> is differentiable over the interval <m>(1,144)</m> (since 0 is not contained in that interval), and <m>f(x)</m> is continuous everywhere, so by the mean value theorem there exists some point <m>c</m> where <m>f'(x)=\dfrac{\sqrt{|144|}-\sqrt{|1|}}{144-1}=\dfrac{11}{143}=\dfrac{1}{13}</m>.
</p>

<p>That being said, an easier way to prove that a point exists is to simply find it--without using the MVT. When <m>x \gt 0</m>, <m>f(x)=\sqrt{x}</m>, so <m>f'(x)=\dfrac{1}{2\sqrt {x}}</m>. Then <m>f'\left(\dfrac{169}{4}\right)=\dfrac{1}{13}</m>.

<m>2</m>
</p></answer>
<solution><p>
The function <m>f(x)</m> is continuous and differentiable over all real numbers.
If <m>a</m> and <m>b</m> are distinct roots of <m>f(x)</m>, then <m>f'(c)=0</m> for some <m>c</m> strictly between <m>a</m> and <m>b</m> (Rolle's Theorem). So, let's think about <m>f'(x)</m>.
<me>
f'(x)=(4x+1)^3+1</me>
</p>

<p>This is simple enough that we can find its zero explicitly:
<md>
<mrow>
(4x+1)^3 +1= 0
\quad \amp\Leftrightarrow \quad
(4x+1)^3 = -1
\quad \Leftrightarrow \quad
4x+1 = -1

<p>Hence <m>f'(c)=0</m> only when <m>c=\dfrac{-1}{2}</m>. That the derivative only has a single zero is very
useful. It means (via Rolle's theorem) that if <m>f(x)</m> has distinct roots <m>a</m> and <m>b</m> with <m>a \lt b</m>,
then we must have <m>a  \lt  \dfrac{-1}{2}  \lt  b</m>.  This also means that <m>f(x)</m> cannot have 3 distinct
roots <m>a,b</m> and (say) <m>q</m> with <m>a \lt b \lt q</m>, because then Rolle's theorem would imply that <m>f'(x)</m> would
have two zeros <mdash/> one between <m>a</m> and <m>b</m> and another between <m>b</m> and <m>q</m>.
</p>

<p>We've learned that <m>f(x)</m> has at most two roots, and we've learned something about where those roots can exist, if there are indeed two of them. But that means <m>f(x)</m> could have 0, 1, or 2 roots.
</p>

<p>It's not easy to find a root of <m>f(x)</m> by inspection. But we can  get a good enough picture of the graph of <m>y=f(x)</m> to tell exactly how many roots there are, just by exploiting the following properties  of <m>f(x)</m> and <m>f'(x)</m>.
<ul>
<li> As <m>x</m> tends to <m>\pm \infty</m>, <m>f(x)</m> tends to <m>+\infty</m>.
</li>
<li> The derivative <m>f'(x)=(4x+1)^3+1</m> is negative for <m>x \lt -\frac{1}{2}</m>
and is positive for <m>x \gt -\frac{1}{2}</m>. That is, <m>f(x)</m> is decreasing
for <m>x \lt -\frac{1}{2}</m> and increasing for  <m>x \gt -\frac{1}{2}</m>.
</li>
<li> <m>f\left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)=\frac{1}{16}-\frac{1}{2} \lt 0</m>.
</li>
</ul>
This means the function must look something like the graph below:</p>

<sidebyside width="50%">
<image><latex-image><![CDATA[\begin{tikzpicture}
\YEaaxis{3}{2}{1}{2}
\draw[thick] plot[domain=-2:1](\x,{(\x+0.5)*(\x+0.5)*(\x+0.5)*(\x+0.5)*0.5-0.5});
\end{tikzpicture}]]></latex-image></image>
</sidebyside>
<p>except we are unsure of the locations of the <m>x</m>-intercepts. At present we only know that one is to the left of <m>x=1/2</m> and one is to the right.
</p>

<p>Note what happens to <m>f(x)</m> as <m>x</m> increases from strongly negative values to strongly positive
values.
<ul>
<li> When <m>x</m> is large and negative, <m>f(x) \gt 0</m>.
</li>
<li> As <m>x</m> increases, <m>f(x)</m> decreases continuously until
<m>x=-\frac{1}{2}</m>, where <m>f(x) \lt 0</m>.
 In particular, since <m>f(-1)=\frac{65}{16} \gt 0</m> and
         <m>f\big(-\frac{1}{2}\big) \lt 0</m>  and <m>f(x)</m> is continuous,
         the intermediate value theorem guarantees that <m>f(x)</m>
         takes the value zero for some <m>x</m> between <m>-\frac{1}{2}</m>
         and <m>-1</m>.
More descriptively put, as <m>x</m> increases from
hugely negative numbers to <m>-\frac{1}{2}</m>, <m>f(x)</m> passes  through zero exactly once.
</li>
<li> As <m>x</m> increases beyond  <m>-\frac{1}{2}</m>, <m>f(x)</m> increases
continuously, starting negative and becoming very large and positive
when <m>x</m> becomes large and positive.
 In particular, since <m>f(0)=\frac{1}{16} \gt 0</m> and
         <m>f\big(-\frac{1}{2}\big) \lt 0</m>  and <m>f(x)</m> is continuous,
         the intermediate value theorem guarantees that <m>f(x)</m>
         takes the value zero for some <m>x</m> between <m>-\frac{1}{2}</m>
         and <m>0</m>.
So, as <m>x</m> increases from
<m>-\frac{1}{2}</m> to near <m>+\infty</m>, <m>f(x)</m>  again passes through
zero exactly once.
</li>
</ul>
So <m>f(x)</m> must have exactly two roots, one with <m>x \lt -\frac{1}{2}</m>
and one with <m>x \gt -\frac{1}{2}</m>.

</p></hint>
<answer><p>
<m>1</m>
</p></answer>
<solution><p>
<ul>
<li> We can see by inspection that <m>f(0)=0</m>, so there is at least one root. We have to determine how many any other roots there are, if any.
</li>
<li> 
The function <m>f(x)</m> is the sum of the two terms <m>x^3</m> and <m>\sin(x^5)</m>. 
A number <m>x</m> is a root of <m>f(x)</m> if and only if the two terms cancel each other exactly for that value of <m>x</m>. That is, <m>x</m> is a root of <m>f</m> if and only if <m>x^3=-\sin(x^5)</m>. To develope some intuition in our hunt for other roots, we sketch, in the same figure, the graphs <m>y=x^3</m> and 
<m>y=-\sin(x^5)</m>. Then the roots of <m>f(x)</m> are precisely the <m>x</m>'s where the two curves 
<m>y=x^3</m> and <m>y= -\sin(x^5)</m> intersect.
</li>
</ul>
</p>
<sidebyside width="62%">
<image source="problems/figs/graphXcubeSin"/>
</sidebyside>
<p>
<ul>
<li>Looking at the sketch, we see that the two curves cannot possibly intersect at any point having 
<m>|x|>1</m> <mdash/> if <m>|x|>1</m>, then <m>|x^3|>1</m> but <m>|-\sin (x^5)|\le 1</m> and we cannot possibly have <m>x^3=-\sin(x^5)</m>. That is, all roots of <m>f(x)</m> are in the interval <m>[-1,1]</m>. 
</li>
<li> From the sketch, we would probably guess that <m>y=x^3</m> and <m>y=-\sin(x^5)</m> cross only at 
<m>x=0</m>. We can use Rolle's Theorem to verify that that is indeed the case.
</li>
<li>
If there is a root <m>a \neq 0</m>, then by Rolle's Theorem (since <m>f(x)</m> is continuous and differentiable for all real numbers <m>x</m>) <m>f'(c)=0</m> for some <m>c</m> strictly between <m>0</m> and 
<m>a</m>. In particular, since we already know any roots <m>a</m> will be between <m>-1</m> and <m>1</m>, if 
<m>f(x)</m> has two roots then <m>f'(c)=0</m> for some <m>c \in (-1,0) \cup (0,1)</m>.
</li>
<li>
The derivative of <m>f</m> is
<me>
f'(x)=3x^2+5x^4\cos\big(x^5\big)=x^2\left(3+5x^2\cos\big(x^5\big)\right)
</me>
So, if <m>f'(x)=0</m>, then <m>x=0</m> or <m>\left(3+5x^2\cos\left(x^5\right)\right)=0</m>. 
If <m>x \in (-1,0) \cup (0,1)</m>, then 
<md>
<mrow>
|x|\lt 1 \amp\implies |x^5|\lt 1\lt \tfrac{\pi}{2}
      \implies \cos\big(x^5\big)>0 
</mrow>
<mrow>
     \amp\implies 3+5x^2\cos\big(x^5\big) > 3 
</mrow>
<mrow>
      \amp\implies f'(x) \neq 0
</mrow>
</md>
That is, there is no <m>c \in (-1,0) \cup (0,1)</m> with <m>f'(c)=0</m>. Therefore, following our last  bullet point, <m>f(x)</m> has only one root.
</li>
</ul>
Note here that <m>f'(x)</m> has many zeroes <mdash/> infinitely many, in fact. However, <m>x=0</m> is the only root of <m>f'(x)</m> in the interval <m>(-1,1)</m>.

How many positive-valued solutions does the equation <m>e^x=4\cos(2x)</m> have?

</p></hint>
<answer><p>
<m>1</m>
</p></answer>
<solution>
<p>We are to find the number of positive solutions to the equation
          <m>e^x = 4\cos(2x)</m>.  The figure below contains the graphs
          of <m>y=e^x</m> and <m>y= 4\cos(2x)</m>. The solutions to
          <m>e^x =  4\cos(2x)</m> are precisely the <m>x</m>'s where
          <m>y=e^x</m> and <m>y= 4\cos(2x)</m> cross.
</p>

<sidebyside width="66%">
<image source="problems/figs/graphExpCos"/>
</sidebyside>

<p> It sure looks like there is exactly one crossing with <m>x\ge 0</m>
         and that one crossing is somewhere between <m>x=0</m> and <m>x=1</m>. Indeed
         since <m>\big[e^x- 4\cos(2x)\big]_{x=0} = -3 \lt 0</m> and
               <m>\big[e^x- 4\cos(2x)\big]_{x=1}  \gt  e  \gt  0</m> and
         <m>f(x)=e^x- 4\cos(2x)</m> is continuous, the intermediate value
         theorem guarantees that there is at least one root with
         <m>0 \lt x \lt 1</m>.
</p>

<p>         We still have to show that there is no second root <mdash/> even if our
         graphs are not accurate.
</p>

<p>Recall that the range of the cosine function is <m>[-1,1]</m>. If <m>e^x=4\cos(2x)</m>, then <m>e^x \leq 4</m>, so <m>x \leq \log(4)\approx 1.39</m>. So, we only need to search for roots of <m>f(x)</m> on the interval <m>(0,1.4)</m>: we are guaranteed there are no roots elsewhere. Over this interval,
<m>2x \in (0,2.8)</m>, so <m>\sin(2x) \gt 0</m>, and thus <m>f'(x)=e^x+8\sin(2 x) \gt 0</m>. Since <m>f'(x)</m> has no roots in <m>(0,1.4)</m>, we conclude by Rolle's Theorem that <m>f(x)</m> has at most one root in <m>(0,1.4)</m> (and so at most one positive root total). Since we've already found that a root of <m>f(x)</m> exists in <m>(0,1)</m>, we conclude
 <m>e^x=4\cos(2x)</m> has precisely one positive-valued solution.

</p></answer>
<solution><p>
If <m>2x+\sin x</m> is one--to--one over an interval, it never takes the same value for two distinct numbers in that interval. By Rolle's Theorem, if <m>f(a)=f(b)</m> for distinct <m>a</m> and <m>b</m>, then
<m>f'(c)=0</m> for some <m>c</m> between <m>a</m> and <m>b</m>. However, <m>f'(x)=2+\cos x</m>, which is never zero. In fact, <m>f'(x)\ge 1</m> for all <m>x</m>, so <m>f(x)</m> is strictly increasing over its entire domain. Therefore, our function <m>f</m> <em>never</em> takes the same value twice, so it is one--to--one over all the real numbers, <m>(-\infty,\infty)</m>.
</p>

<p>When we define the inverse function <m>f^{-1}(x)</m>, the domain of <m>f</m> is the range of <m>f^{-1}</m>, and vice-versa. In general, we might have to <em>restrict</em> the domain of <m>f</m> (and hence the range of <m>f^{-1}</m>) to an interval where <m>f</m> is one--to--one, but in our case, this isn't necessary. So, the range of <m>f^{-1}</m> is <m>(-\infty,\infty)</m> and the domain of <m>f^{-1}</m> is the range of <m>f</m>: <m>(-\infty,\infty)</m>.

In order for <m>f^{-1}(x)</m> to be defined over an interval, <m>f(x)</m> must be one--to--one over that interval.

One--to--one interval, and range of <m>f^{-1}</m>: <m>\left[-\frac{2\pi}{3},\frac{2\pi}{3}\right]</m>

</p></answer>
<solution><p>
If <m>f(x)=\dfrac{x}{2}+\sin x</m> is one--to--one over an interval, it never takes the same value for two distinct numbers in that interval. By Rolle's Theorem, if <m>f(a)=f(b)</m> for distinct <m>a</m> and <m>b</m>, then
<m>f'(c)=0</m> for some <m>c</m> between <m>a</m> and <m>b</m>. Since <m>f'(x)=\frac{1}{2}+\cos x</m>,
<m>f'(x)=0</m> when <m>x=2n\pi\pm\frac{2\pi}{3}</m> for some integer <m>n</m>. So, in particular, if  <m>a</m> and <m>b</m> are distinct numbers in the interval <m>\left[-\frac{2\pi}{3},\frac{2\pi}{3}\right]</m>, then for every <m>c</m> strictly between <m>a</m> and <m>b</m>, <m>f'(c) \neq 0</m>, so by Rolle's Theorem <m>f(a) \neq f(b)</m>. Therefore <m>f(x)</m> is one--to--one on the interval <m>\left[-\frac{2\pi}{3},\frac{2\pi}{3}\right]</m>.
</p>

<p>We should also show that the interval <m>\left[-\frac{2\pi}{3},\frac{2\pi}{3}\right]</m> cannot be extended to a larger interval over which <m>f(x)</m> is still one--to--one.
Consider the derivative <m>f'(x) = \frac{1}{2}+\cos x</m>.
           For all <m>-\frac{2\pi}{3}  \lt  x  \lt  \frac{2\pi}{3}</m>, we have
           <m>\cos x  \gt  -\frac{1}{2}</m> (sketch the graph of <m>\cos x</m>
           yourself) so that <m>f'(x) \gt 0</m> and <m>f(x)</m> is
           increasing. But at <m>x=\frac{2\pi}{3}</m>, <m>f'(x)=0</m>, and then
           for <m>x</m> a bit bigger than  <m>\frac{2\pi}{3}</m> we have
           <m>\cos x  \lt  -\frac{1}{2}</m> so that <m>f'(x) \lt 0</m> and <m>f(x)</m> is
           decreasing. So the graph <q>reverses direction</q>, and <m>f(x)</m>
           repeats values. (See the graph of <m>y=f(x)</m> below.) The
           same is true for <m>x</m> a little smaller than <m>-\frac{2\pi}{3}.</m>

Since <m>f(x)</m> is differentiable over all real numbers, it is also continuous over all real numbers. We claim that <m>f(x)</m> cannot have four or more distinct roots. For every two distinct roots <m>a \lt b</m>, Rolle's Theorem tells us there is a <m>c \in (a,b)</m> such that <m>f'(c)=0</m>: that is, <m>c</m> is a root of <m>f'</m>.

<p>From the figure, it sure looks like there are two crossings.
         Since the function <m>-\sin x</m> has range <m>[-1,1]</m>,
         if the two functions cross, then also <m>-1 \leq x^2+5x+1\leq 1 </m>.
         This portion of the quadratic function is highlighted in blue in the figure.
         The <m>x</m> coordinates of the end points
         of the blue arcs are found by solving <m>x^2+5x+1 = \pm1</m>,
         i.e. <m>x=0</m>, <m>-5</m>, and (using the quadratic equation)
         <m>x= \frac{-5\pm\sqrt{17}}{2}</m>.
</p>

<p>         We are now in a position
         to exploit the intuition that we have built using the above
         figure to write a concise argument showing that <m>f(x)</m> has exactly
         two roots.
         Remember that, in general, if we want to show that a function has <m>n</m> roots, we need to show that there exist <m>n</m> distinct roots somewhere, and that there do not exist <m>n+1</m> distinct roots. This argument is given below, in blue text.
<textblue>
<ul>
<li> <m>f(x)</m> is continuous over all real numbers
</li>
<li> <m>f(x)=0</m> only when <m>-\sin x=x^2+5x+1</m>, which only happens when <m>|x^2+5x+1| \leq 1</m>. Thus, <m>f(x)</m> only has roots in the intervals
<m>\left[-5,\frac{-5-\sqrt{17}}{2}\right]</m> and <m>\left[\frac{-5+\sqrt{17}}{2},0\right]</m>.
</li>
<li>  <m>f(-5)=\sin(-5)+1  \gt  0</m>, and <m>f\left(\frac{-5-\sqrt{17}}{2}\right)=\sin\left(\frac{-5-\sqrt{17}}{2}\right)-1  \lt 0</m>. So, by the IVT, <m>f(c)=0</m> for some
<m>c \in \left(-5,\frac{-5-\sqrt{17}}{2}\right)</m>.
</li>
<li> <m>f(0)=1 \gt 0</m>, and <m>f\left(\frac{-5+\sqrt{17}}{2}\right)=\sin\left(\frac{-5+\sqrt{17}}{2}\right)-1 \lt 0</m>. So, by the IVT, <m>f(c)=0</m> for some
<m>c \in \left(\frac{-5+\sqrt{17}}{2},0\right)</m>.
</li>
<li> <m>f'(x)=\cos x + 2x + 5</m>. If <m>f'(x)=0</m>, then <m>2x+5=-\cos x</m>, so <m>|2x+5| \leq 1</m>. So, the only interval that can contain roots of <m>f'(x)</m> is <m>[-3,-2]</m>.
</li>
<li><p> Suppose <m>f(x)</m> has more than two roots. Then it has two roots in the interval
<m>\left[-5,\frac{-5-\sqrt{17}}{2}\right]</m> OR it has two roots in the interval
<m>\left[\frac{-5+\sqrt{17}}{2},0\right]</m>. Since <m>f(x)</m> is differentiable for all real numbers,  Rolle's Theorem tells us that <m>f'(x)</m> has a root in <m>\left(-5,\frac{-5-\sqrt{17}}{2}\right)</m> or in <m>\left(\frac{-5+\sqrt{17}}{2},0\right)</m>. However, since all roots of <m>f'(x)</m> are in the interval <m>[-3,-2]</m>, and this interval shares no points with <m>\left(-5,\frac{-5-\sqrt{17}}{2}\right)</m> or <m>\left(\frac{-5+\sqrt{17}}{2},0\right)</m>, this cannot be the case. Therefore <m>f(x)</m> does not have more than two roots.</p>
