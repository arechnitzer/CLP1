<statement><p>
Suppose the quantities <m>P</m> and <m>Q</m> are related by the formula <m>P=Q^3</m>. <m>P</m> and <m>Q</m> are changing with respect to time, <m>t</m>. Given this information, which of the following are problems you could solve?
<ol label="i">
<li> Given <m>\ds\diff{P}{t}(0)</m>, find <m>\ds\diff{Q}{t}(0)</m>. (Remember: the notation <m>\ds\diff{P}{t}(0)</m> means the derivative of <m>P</m> with respect to <m>t</m> at the time <m>t=0</m>.)

<hint><p>
If you know <m>P</m>, you can figure out <m>Q</m>.
</p></hint>
<answer><p>
ii and iv
</p></answer>
<solution><p>
We have an equation relating <m>P</m> and <m>Q</m>:
<md>
<mrow>
P&amp;=Q^3
</mrow>
<intertext>We differentiate implicitly with respect to a third variable, <m>t</m>:</intertext><mrow>
\diff{P}{t}&amp;=3Q^2\cdot\diff{Q}{t}
</mrow>
</md>
If we know two of the three quantities <m>\ds\diff{P}{t}</m>, <m>Q</m>, and <m>\ds\diff{Q}{t}</m>, then we can find the third. Therefore, ii is a question we can solve. If we know <m>P</m>, then we also know <m>Q</m> (it's just the cube root of <m>P</m>), so also we can solve iv. However, if we know neither <m>P</m> nor <m>Q</m>, then we can't find <m>\ds\diff{P}{t}</m> based only off <m>\ds\diff{Q}{t}</m>, and
we can't find <m>\ds\diff{Q}{t}</m> based only off <m>\ds\diff{P}{t}</m>. So we can't solve i or iii.

<p> We can calculate the volume of water in the trough by multiplying the area of its trapezoidal cross section by 200 cm. A  trapezoid with height <m>h</m> and bases <m>b_1</m> and <m>b_2</m> has area <m>h\left(\frac{b_1+b_2}{2}\right)</m>. (To see why this is so, draw the trapezoid as a rectangle flanked by two triangles.)
So, using  <m>w</m> as the width of the top of the water (as in the diagram above), the area of the cross section of the water in the trough is
<me>
A=h\left(\frac{60+w}{2}\right)</me>
</p>

<p>and therefore the volume of water in the trough is

<p>A hose is filling the tank up at a rate of one litre per second. How fast is the height of the water increasing when the water is 10 centimetres deep?
</p></statement>
<hint><p>
Be careful with units. One litre is 1000 cm<m>^3</m>, which is not the same as <m>10</m> m<m>^3</m>.
</p></hint>
<answer><p>
<m>\dfrac{1}{29200}</m> metres per second (or about 1 centimetre every five minutes)
</p></answer>
<solution><p>
If <m>V</m> is the volume of the water in the tank, and <m>t</m> is time, then we are given <m>\ds\diff{V}{t}</m>. What we want to know is <m>\ds\diff{h}{t}</m>, where <m>h</m> is the height of the water in the tank. A reasonable plan is to find an equation relating <m>V</m> and <m>h</m>, and differentiate it implicitly with respect to <m>t</m>.
</p>

<p>Let's be a little careful about units.
The volume of water in the tank is
<me>
\text{(area of cross section of water)$\times$(length of tank)}
</me>
 If we measure these values in metres (area in square metres, length in metres), then the volume is going to be in cubic metres. So, when we differentiate with respect to time, our units will be cubic metres per second. The water is flowing in at one litre per second, or <m>1000</m> cubic centimetres per second. So, we either have to measure our areas and distances in centimetres, or convert litres to cubic metres. We'll do the latter, but both are fine.
</p>

<p> If we imagine one cubic metre as a cube, with each side of length 1 metre, then it's easy to see the volume inside is <m>(100)^3=10^6</m> cubic centimetres: it's the volume of a cube with each side of length 100 cm. Since a litre is <m>10^3</m> cubic centimetres, and a cubic metre is <m>10^{6}</m> cubic centimetres, one litre is <m>10^{-3}</m> cubic metres.
So, <m>\textcolor{red}{\ds\diff{V}{t}=\frac{1}{10^3}}</m> cubic metres per second.
</p>

<p>Let <m>h</m> be the height of the water (in metres). We can figure out the area of the cross section by breaking it into three pieces: a triangle on the left, a rectangle in the middle, and a trapezoid on the right.

At 4:00, the minute hand is straight up, and the hour hand is <m>\dfrac{4}{12}=\dfrac{1}{3}</m> of the way around the clock, so <m>\textcolor{red}{\theta = \dfrac{1}{3}(2\pi)=\dfrac{2\pi}{3}}</m> at 4:00. Then

</p>

<p>To calculate <m>\ds\diff{\theta}{t}</m>, remember that both hands are moving. The hour hand makes a full rotation every 12 hours, so its rotational speed is <m>\dfrac{2\pi}{12}=\dfrac{\pi}{6}</m> radians per hour. The hour hand is being chased by the minute hand. The minute hand makes a full rotation every hour, so its rotational speed is <m>\dfrac{2\pi}{1}=2\pi</m> radians per hour.

<statement><p>
Two spheres are centred at the same point. The radius <m>R</m> of the bigger sphere at time <m>t</m> is given by <m>R(t)=10+2t</m>, while the radius <m>r</m> of the smaller sphere is given by <m>r(t)=6t</m>, <m>t \ge 0</m>. How fast is the volume between the spheres (inside the big sphere and outside the small sphere) changing when the bigger sphere has a radius twice as large as the smaller?
</p></statement>
<hint><p>
The volume of a sphere with radius <m>R</m> is <m>\dfrac{4}{3}\pi r^3</m>.
</p></hint>
<answer><p>
<m>288</m> cubic units per unit time
</p></answer>
<solution><p>
The volume between the spheres, while the little one is inside the big one, is
<me>
V=\frac{4}{3}\pi R^3 - \frac{4}{3}\pi r^3</me>
</p>

<p>Differentiating implicitly with respect to <m>t</m>:
<me>
\diff{V}{t}=4\pi R^2\diff{R}{t}-4\pi r^2\diff{r}{t}</me>
</p>

<p>We differentiate <m>R=10+2t</m> and <m>r=6t</m> to find <m>\ds\diff{R}{t}=2</m> and <m>\ds\diff{r}{t}=6</m>. When <m>R=2r</m>, <m>10+2t=2(6t)</m>, so <m>t=1</m>. When <m>t=1</m>, <m>R=12</m> and <m>r=6</m>. So:
<me>
\diff{V}{t}=4\pi\left(12^2\right)(2)-4\pi\left(6^2\right)(6)=288\pi</me>
</p>

<p>So the volume between the two spheres is increasing at 288 cubic units per unit time.
</p>

<p>Remark: when the radius of the inner sphere increases, we are <q>subtracting</q> more area. Since the radius of the inner sphere grows faster than the radius of the outer sphere, we might expect the area between the spheres to be decreasing. Although the radius of the outer sphere grows more slowly, a small increase in the radius of the outer sphere results in a larger change in volume than the same increase in the radius of the inner sphere. So, a result showing that the volume between the spheres is increasing is not unreasonable.

The easiest way to figure out the area of the sector of an annulus (or a circle) is to
figure out the area of the entire annulus, then multiply by what proportion of the entire annulus the sector is. For example, if your sector is <m>\frac{1}{10}</m> of the entire annulus, then its area is <m>\frac{1}{10}</m> of the area of the entire annulus. (See Section<nbsp/><xref ref="app_rad_arc_sec"/>

Let <m>S</m> be the flow of salt (in cubic centimetres per second). We want to know <m>\ds\diff{S}{t}</m>: how fast the flow is changing at time <m>t</m>. We are given an equation for <m>S</m>:

We are given information about how quickly the door is rotating. If we let <m>\theta</m> be the angle made by the leading edge of the door and the far edge of the cut-out (shown below), then <m>\ds\diff{\theta}{t}=-\dfrac{\pi}{6}</m> radians per second. (Since the door is covering more and more of the cut-out, <m>\theta</m> is getting smaller, so <m>\ds\diff{\theta}{t}</m> is negative.)

<p>The area of an annulus with outer radius 6 cm and inner radius 1 cm is

A sector of that same annulus with angle <m>\theta</m> has area <m>\left(\frac{\theta}{2\pi}\right)(35\pi)</m>, since <m>\frac{\theta}{2\pi}</m> is the ratio of the sector to the entire annulus.

We want to conclude that <m>\theta = \arccos(1-h)</m>, but let's be a little careful: remember that the range of the arccosine function is angles in <m>[0,\pi]</m>. We must be confident that <m>0\le\theta\le\pi</m> in order to conclude <m>\theta = \arccos(1-h)</m>--but clearly, <m>\theta</m> is in this range.

The volume of a cone with height <m>h</m> and radius <m>r</m> is <m>\frac{1}{3}\pi r^2h</m>.

<answer><p>
<m>\dfrac{-15}{49\pi}\approx -0.097</m>  cm per minute
</p></answer>
<solution><p>
We are given the rate of change of the volume of liquid, and are asked for the rate of change of the height of the liquid. So, we need an equation relating volume and height.
</p>

<p>The volume <m>V</m> of a cone with height <m>h</m> and radius <m>r</m> is <m>\frac{1}{3}\pi r^2h</m>. Since we know <m>\ds\diff{V}{t}</m>, and want to know <m>\ds\diff{h}{t}</m>, we need to find a way to deal with the unwanted variable <m>r</m>. We can find <m>r</m> in terms of <m>h</m> by using similar triangles. Viewed from the side, the conical glass is an equilateral triangle, as is the water in it. Using the Pythagorean Theorem, the cone has height <m>5\sqrt{3}</m>.

</p></answer>
<solution><p>
(a) When the point is at <m>(0,-2)</m>, its <m>y</m>-coordinate is not changing, because it is moving along a horizontal line. So, the rate at which the particle moves is simply <m>\ds\diff{x}{t}</m>. Let <m>\theta</m> be the angle an observer would be looking at, in order to watch the point.
Since we know <m>\ds\diff{\theta}{t}</m>, a reasonable plan is to find an equation relating <m>\theta</m> and <m>x</m>, and then differentiate implicitly with respect to <m>t</m>. To do this, let's return to our diagram.

<p>When the point is a little to the right of <m>(0,-2)</m>, then we can make a triangle with the origin, as shown. If we let <m>\theta</m> be the indicated angle, then <m>\ds\diff{\theta}{t}=1</m> radian per second. (It is given that the observer is turning one radian per second, so this is how fast <m>\theta</m> is increasing.) From the right triangle in the diagram, we see
<me>
\tan\theta=\frac{x}{2}</me>
</p>

<p>Now, we have to take care of a subtle point. The diagram we drew only makes sense for the point when it is at a position a little to the <em>right</em> of <m>(0,-2)</m>. So, right now, we've only made a set-up that will find the derivative <em>from the right</em>. But, with a little more thought, we see that even when <m>x</m> is negative (that is, when the point is a little to the <em>left</em> of <m>(0,-2)</m>), our equation holds if we are careful about how we define <m>\theta</m>. Let <m>\theta</m> be  the angle between the line connecting the point and the origin, and the <m>y</m>-axis, where <m>\theta</m> is <em>negative</em> when the point is to the left of the <m>y</m>-axis.

<p>(b) When the point is at <m>(0,2)</m>, it is moving along a line with slope <m>-\frac{1}{2}</m> and <m>y</m>-intercept <m>2</m>. So, it is on the line

<p>For the question <q>How fast is the point moving?</q>, remember that the velocity of an object can be found by differentiating  (with respect to <em>time</em>) the equation that gives the position of the object. The complicating factors in this case are that (1) the position of our object is not given as a function of time, and (2) the position of our object is given in two dimensions (an <m>x</m> coordinate and a <m>y</m> coordinate), not one.
</p>

<p><textblue>Remark: the solution below is actually pretty complicated.  It is within your abilities to figure it out, but later on in your mathematical career you will learn an easier way, using vectors. For now, take this as a relatively tough exercise, and a motivation to keep learning: your intuition that <em>there must be an easier way</em> is well founded!</textblue>
</p>

<p>The point is moving along a straight line. So, to take care of complication (2), we can give its position as a point on the line. We can take the line as a sort of axis. We'll need to choose a point on the axis to be the <q>origin</q>: <m>(2,1)</m> is a convenient point. Let <m>D</m> be the point's (signed) distance along the <q>axis</q> from <m>(2,1)</m>. When the point is a distance of one unit to the left of <m>(2,1)</m>, we'll have <m>D=-1</m>, and
when the point is a distance of one unit to the right of <m>(2,1)</m>, we'll have <m>D=1</m>.
Then <m>D</m> changes with respect to time, and <m>\ds\diff{D}{t}</m> is the velocity of the point. Since we know <m>\ds\diff{x}{t}</m> and <m>\ds\diff{y}{t}</m>, a reasonable plan is to find an equation relating <m>x</m>, <m>y</m>, and <m>D</m>, and differentiate implicitly with respect to <m>t</m>.

<p>(b) The area of the base of the bottle is <m>\pi a b</m>

The water will spill out at a rate of <m>-\ds\diff{V}{t}</m> cubic centimetres per second, where <m>V</m> is the volume inside the bottle. We know something about <m>a</m> and <m>\ds\diff{a}{t}</m>, so a reasonable plan is to differentiate the equation from (b) (relating <m>V</m> and <m>a</m>) with respect to <m>t</m>.
</p>

<p>Using the product rule, we differentiate the equation in (b) implicitly with respect to <m>t</m> and get
<me>
\diff{V}{t}=20\pi\left(\diff{a}{t}b+a\diff{b}{t}\right)</me>
</p>

<p>So, we need to find the values of <m>\textcolor{red}{a}</m>, <m>\textcolor{red}{b}</m>,
<m>\textcolor{red}{\ds\diff{a}{t}}</m>, and <m>\textcolor{red}{\ds\diff{b}{t}}</m> at the moment when <m>a=2b</m>.
</p>

<p>The equation from (a) tells us <m>10=3(a+b)-\sqrt{(a+3b)(3a+b)}</m>. So, when <m>a=2b</m>,
<md>
<mrow>
10&amp;=3(2b+b)-\sqrt{(2b+3b)(6b+b)}
</mrow><mrow>
10&amp;=9b-\sqrt{(5b)(7b)}=b\left(9-\sqrt{35}\right)
</mrow><mrow>
\color{red}b&amp;\color{red}{=\frac{10}{9-\sqrt{35}}}
</mrow>
<intertext>where we use the fact that <m>b</m> is a positive number, so <m>\sqrt{b^2}=|b|=b</m>. </intertext><mrow></mrow>
<intertext>Since <m>a=2b</m>,</intertext><mrow>
\color{red}a&amp;\color{red}{=\frac{20}{9-\sqrt{35}}}
</mrow>
<intertext>Now we know <m>a</m> and <m>b</m> at the moment when <m>a=2b</m>. We still need to know <m>\ds\diff{a}{t}</m> and <m>\ds\diff{b}{t}</m> at that moment. Since <m>a=5+t</m>, always <m>\textcolor{red}{\ds\diff{a}{t}=1}</m>. The equation from (a) relates <m>a</m> and <m>b</m>, so differentiating both sides with respect to <m>t</m> will give us an equation relating <m>\ds\diff{a}{t}</m> and <m>\ds\diff{b}{t}</m>. When differentiating the portion with a square root, be careful not to forget the chain rule.</intertext><mrow>
0&amp;=3\left(\diff{a}{t}+\diff{b}{t}\right)-\frac{\left(\diff{a}{t}+3\diff{b}{t}\right)(3a+b)+(a+3b)\left(3\diff{a}{t}+\diff{b}{t}\right)}{2\sqrt{(a+3b)(3a+b)}}

<intertext>Since <m>\ds\diff{a}{t}=1</m>:</intertext><mrow>

</mrow>
</md>
At this point, we could plug in the values we know for <m>a</m> and <m>b</m> at the moment when <m>a=2b</m>. However, the algebra goes a little smoother if we start by plugging in <m>a=2b</m>:
<md>
<mrow>
0&amp;=3\left(1+\diff{b}{t}\right)-\frac{\left(1+3\diff{b}{t}\right)(7b)+(5b)\left(3+\diff{b}{t}\right)}{2\sqrt{(5b)(7b)}}

0&amp;=3\left(1+\diff{b}{t}\right)-\frac{b\left(7+21\diff{b}{t}+15+5\diff{b}{t}\right)}{2b\sqrt{35}}

0&amp;=3\left(1+\diff{b}{t}\right)-\frac{22+26\diff{b}{t}}{2\sqrt{35}}
</mrow><mrow>
0&amp;=3+3\diff{b}{t}-\frac{11}{\sqrt{35}}-\frac{13}{\sqrt{35}}\diff{b}{t}
</mrow><mrow>
-3+\frac{11}{\sqrt{35}}&amp;=\left(3-\frac{13}{\sqrt{35}}\right)\diff{b}{t}
</mrow><mrow>
\diff{b}{t}&amp;=\frac{-3+\frac{11}{\sqrt{35}}}{3-\frac{13}{\sqrt{35}}}
=\frac{-3\sqrt{35}+11}{3\sqrt{35}-13}
</mrow>
</md>
Now, we can calculate <m>\ds\diff{V}{t}</m> at the moment when <m>a=2b</m>. We already found
<md>
<mrow>
\diff{V}{t}&amp;=20\pi\left(\diff{a}{t}b+a\diff{b}{t}\right)
</mrow>
</md>
So, plugging in the values of <m>a</m>, <m>b</m>, <m>\ds\diff{a}{t}</m>, and <m>\ds\diff{b}{t}</m> at the moment when <m>a=2b</m>: 
<md>
<mrow>
\diff{V}{t}&amp;=20\pi\left((1)\left(\frac{10}{9-\sqrt{35}}\right)+\left(\frac{20}{9-\sqrt{35}}\right)\left(\frac{-3\sqrt{35}+11}{3\sqrt{35}-13}\right)\right)
</mrow><mrow>
&amp;=\frac{200\pi}{9-\sqrt{35}}\left(1-2\left(\frac{3\sqrt{35}-11}{3\sqrt{35}-13}\right)\right)
</mrow><mrow>
&amp;\approx -375.4\;\frac{\mathrm{cm}^3}{\mathrm{sec}}

</md>
So the water is spilling out of the cup at about 375.4 cubic centimetres per second.

<p>Remark: the algebra in this problem got a little nasty, but the method behind its solution is no more difficult than most of the problems in this section. One of the reasons why calculus is so widely taught in universities is to give you lots of practice with problem-solving: taking a big problem, breaking it into pieces you can manage, solving the pieces, and getting a solution.
</p>

<p>A problem like this can sometimes derail people. Breaking it up into pieces isn't so hard, but when you actually do those pieces, you can get confused and forget why you are doing the calculations you're doing. If you find yourself in this situation, look back a few steps to remind yourself why you started the calculation you just did. It can also be helpful to write notes, like
<q>We are trying to find <m>\diff{V}{t}</m>. We already know that
                <m>\diff{V}{t} = ...</m>. We still need to find <m>a</m>, <m>b</m>,
                <m>\diff{a}{t}</m> and <m>\diff{b}{t}</m>.</q>
